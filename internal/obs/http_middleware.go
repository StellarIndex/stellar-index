// HTTPMetrics returns middleware that emits `http_requests_total`
// + `http_request_duration_seconds` for every served request.
//
// Label discipline:
//   - `method`: the HTTP verb (uppercase).
//   - `route`: the registered route pattern path (e.g. "/v1/assets/{asset_id}"),
//     NOT the raw URL — using the raw URL would blow up cardinality
//     on endpoints with ID path params. The method prefix is stripped
//     from Go 1.22+ patterns so it doesn't duplicate `method`.
//   - `status`: HTTP status code as a string; dashboards regex-filter
//     (status=~"5..") for bucketing.
//
// # Route pattern discovery
//
// Go 1.22+ ServeMux exposes the matched pattern via
// http.Request.Pattern, but only on the request struct the mux was
// dispatched with — and any middleware between HTTPMetrics and the
// mux that calls `r = r.WithContext(...)` (Logger does, to attach
// request_id / remote_ip) creates a fresh struct, leaving
// HTTPMetrics holding a Request whose Pattern stays "".
//
// To survive the WithContext shadow-copy chain we plant a
// *routeCapture pointer in the request context. The innermost
// [CaptureRoute] middleware writes r.Pattern into it after
// dispatch; HTTPMetrics reads from the same pointer. The pointer
// itself is in the context, and contexts pass through WithContext
// chains unchanged, so all middlewares see the same routeCapture.
//
// For unmatched routes (404) the pattern is empty; we label those
// as `"unmatched"` to keep cardinality bounded.
