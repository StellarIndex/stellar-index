// Reference is a pluggable external price reference. Each
// implementation maps to one external oracle / aggregator
// (CoinGecko, CMC, Reflector, Band, etc.) and exposes one method
// to fetch the price the source reports for a given pair.
//
// Implementations:
//
//   - MUST be safe for concurrent LookupPrice calls
//   - SHOULD set a per-call timeout via the supplied ctx (caller
//     also bounds it but the implementation is the closest layer
//     to the network)
//   - SHOULD return [ErrAssetUnsupported] when the source doesn't
//     list the asset (so [Compare] can record the gap without
//     treating it as a transport failure)

	// (acceptable when the bucket is recent — within minutes —
	// and the operator accepts the staleness on the divergence

// degradation signal. An asset that genuinely isn't listed on
// CoinGecko is information for the operator (consider adding the
// pair to the source's supported list, or accept a smaller
// reference universe for that pair); a transport failure is a
// transient outage signal.
