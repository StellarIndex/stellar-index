// Package contractid provides the shared contract-identity registry
// that factory-anchored Soroban decoders use to gate Matches().
//
// Per ADR-0035, a decoder must only accept events from contracts that
// belong to its protocol: the protocol's factory (a hard-coded trust
// root) plus every child contract the factory creates — fanning out
// recursively. Topic symbols (`swap`, `supply`, `deploy`, …) are NOT
// unique across protocols, so matching on the topic alone mis-attributes
// foreign contracts' events. The factory check is decoder-specific (the
// decoder knows which classify() result is its creation event); this
// package owns the second half: the set of factory-descended child
// contract IDs, plus the live-upsert persistence hook.
//
// A Registry is a small piece of state every gated decoder embeds. It is
// seeded three ways, all rooted at the factory and all funneling through
// [Registry.Seed]:
//
//   - Live: the decoder calls Seed(childID, ledger) when it decodes a
//     factory creation event (e.g. Blend `deploy`, Soroswap-style
//     `new_pair`). Seed fires the persistence hook so the mapping is
//     durably recorded.
//   - DB warm: at process start the pipeline loads the persisted child
//     set (the `protocol_contracts` table) and constructs the decoder
//     with WithSeed — so a restart resumes with a complete registry even
//     though the projector cursor has advanced past the creation events.
//   - Genesis / reconcile: an operator command (or the ADR-0033 reconcile
//     pre-seed) walks the lake for the factory's creation events from the
//     factory's deploy ledger and Seeds each child.
//
// Concurrency: the dispatcher and projector are serial per source, but
// Seed may be called from operator tooling concurrently with reads, so
// the set is mutex-guarded (belt-and-braces, matching soroswap's
// Decoder).
