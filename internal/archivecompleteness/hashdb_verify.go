// HashDBWindowVerifier accumulates a [HashDBVerifyResult] as the

// each LCM ... appends a record. A periodic verifier later re-reads
// the same bucket, recomputes sha256, and compares" — this type is
// the compare half.
//
// Deliberately transport-agnostic: it does NOT itself re-read the
// datastore or depend on xdr.LedgerCloseMeta. Re-reading the bucket
// (typically via ledgerstream.Stream) and computing each ledger's
// hash (hashdb.Hash(lcm.MarshalBinary())) is the caller's job — see
// cmd/stellarindex-indexer's periodic verify sweep for the production
// wiring. This keeps internal/archivecompleteness free of the
// ledger-meta xdr dependency scripts/ci/lint-imports.sh's
// B/xdr-scoped-to-scval rule polices (ADR-0013): only packages on the
// ledger-meta plumbing path (ledgerstream, dispatcher, pipeline, the
// indexer/ops binaries) are allow-listed for it, and this package
// isn't ledger-meta plumbing — it's a comparison, fed pre-hashed
