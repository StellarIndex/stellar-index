// unchanged — aggregate.DecimalsLookup is a pure consumer of whatever
// table backs the guard, never the detection logic itself).

// table (migration 0093) — the source of truth this package's callers are
// expected to consult. found=false (including for a nil receiver, or a nil
// DecimalsLookup passed to [ResolveDecimals]) means "nothing on record for
// this asset" and MUST be treated as [StandardDecimals], never as an error —
// everything absent from that table is 7dp by policy.

// AdjustPrice scales a raw quote/base price ratio by the decimals factor

//
// This is the single normalization primitive every ratio-producing call
// site in this codebase (VWAP, TWAP, OHLC open/high/low/close, and any
// CAGG-sourced ratio read back at serve time) should apply before a price
// leaves the process. It is deliberately a POST-HOC scalar multiply, not a
// change to how VWAP/TWAP/OHLC sum trades — because every trade contributing
// to one aggregation call shares the same (base_asset, quote_asset) pair,
// the correction factor is a single per-call constant, so multiplying the
// finished ratio (or, for VWAP/TWAP, the finished weighted-average ratio —
// linear operations commute with a constant scalar) is exactly equivalent
// to normalizing every trade before summing, without the risk of touching
// the summation itself. See docs/operations/runbooks/dex-nonstandard-decimals.md
// for the full rationale (why this replaces the deferred "rewrite the CAGGs"
// plan) and CLAUDE.md's ADR-0003 note.
//
// Returns nil unchanged (nothing to scale). baseDecimals == quoteDecimals
// returns raw itself (not a copy) — callers that need to avoid aliasing
// should not rely on this, but every current call site treats the result
// as an immutable value immediately consumed for formatting.
