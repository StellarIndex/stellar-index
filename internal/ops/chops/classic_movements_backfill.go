// unwedge it. A window that cannot finish inside this deadline is
// aborted and retried exactly once on fresh connections
// (StreamClassicOps / StreamEntryChanges dial per call, so a retry
// gets new sockets); a second expiry within the same deadline is
// treated as a real error, not retried again. Generous bound: the

// classicMovementsBackfill is the ADR-0047 write path for ALL FOUR
// phases, RETARGETED by ADR-0048 D2 to write ClickHouse's
// stellar.account_movements instead of Postgres' classic_movements
// (migration 0105 stays applied but UNPOPULATED — see
// migrations/README.md's 0105 row): stellarindex-ops
// classic-movements-backfill -ch-addr ADDR -from N -to N [-window N]
// [-resume] [-write] [-verify]. Lake-in, lake-out — no Postgres
// anywhere in this command's loop (ADR-0048 D2's explicit
// requirement), unlike the pre-0048 version this replaces.
//
// Each window streams TWO decode surfaces from ClickHouse:
//   - the op-only surface (classicmovements.SupportedOpTypes /
//     Decoder.Decode) — Phases 1-3 plus Phase 4's AccountMerge;
//   - the entry-changes-correlated surface
//     (classicmovements.EntryChangeOpTypes /
//     classicmovements.DecodeLiquidityPoolOp /
//     classicmovements.DecodeCAP0038Revocation) — Phase 4's
//     LiquidityPoolDeposit/Withdraw and the CAP-0038 AllowTrust/
//     SetTrustLineFlags edge case, correlated per-op against
//     clickhouse.StreamEntryChanges output gathered for the same
//     window (see entrychanges.go's package doc for why this can't
//     go through Decoder.Decode).
//
// Both surfaces write into the SAME per-window batch, fanned out
// (one classicmovements.Movement -> 1-2 stellar.account_movements
// rows, ADR-0048 D2's direction discriminator) and batch-inserted via
// clickhouse.InsertAccountMovements.
//
// Phase 3's ClaimableBalance claim/clawback correlation (research
// §2's "b+own-index" path) resolves in three tiers per window:
// Decoder's free in-memory BalanceId index first, a single batched
// ClickHouse lookup (clickhouse.FindClaimableBalanceCreates, one query
// for the whole window's misses, scanning what THIS command has itself
// already written to stellar.account_movements) second for creates
// outside this run, and an explicit unresolved count — never a guessed
// amount — for anything neither finds. See
// classicmovements/dispatcher_adapter.go's Decoder doc for the memory-
// scaling reason operators should chunk `-from`/`-to` into multi-
// million-ledger invocations once Phase 3 volume is in play.
//
// Phase 4's entry-changes surface runs a cheap per-window fidelity
// probe (clickhouse.CountOpScopedEntryChanges) before deciding how to
// treat "no correlated entry changes found" for each op type:
// LiquidityPoolDeposit/Withdraw treat it as
// classicmovements.ErrEntryChangesUnavailable regardless (a real
// deposit/withdraw always mutates the pool, so absence always means
// unavailable fidelity); AllowTrust/SetTrustLineFlags are SKIPPED
// entirely for the window when the probe finds zero fidelity (their
// empty-changes case is indistinguishable from "no liquidation
// happened," which is by far the common case, so treating it as
// "checked, none found" during the fidelity-absent era would
// silently under-report CAP-0038 liquidations). As of this writing,
// EVERY window this command can address (hard-clamped below P23,
// 58,762,517) predates ledger_entry_changes' current per-op fidelity
// floor (~61,996,000, research §3.2) — Phase 0's `ch-backfill` is a
// separate, operator-scheduled prerequisite that closes this gap;
// until it runs, every LP op reports unavailable and every CAP-0038
// check is skipped, both counted and logged, never guessed.
//
// Deliberately does NOT reuse ch-rebuild's generic
// pipeline.HandleEvent write path: classicmovements.MovementEvent is
// historical-only (ADR-0047 D2) and has no HandleEvent persist arm
// by design (see internal/pipeline/lockstep_ast_test.go's
// notSunkEvents entry) — this command is its own dedicated,
// self-contained writer.
//
// Defaults to DRY-RUN (count only); pass -write to persist.
// Windowed + resumable, but — per ADR-0048 D2's "no Postgres in the
// loop" — resume is now DATA-DERIVED rather than cursor-persisted:
// -resume (default true) queries clickhouse.MaxAccountMovementLedger
// for the highest ledger already written in [-from,-to] and restarts
// FROM that ledger (not past it — a deliberate one-ledger overlap so
// a crash mid-window can never silently skip a partially-written
// ledger; ReplacingMergeTree absorbs the resulting duplicate insert
// for free). This mirrors ch-participant-backfill / ch-txindex-
// backfill's "the data IS the checkpoint" convention rather than a
// separate ingestion_cursors row. Idempotent either way — ClickHouse
// re-inserting an already-written window collapses at merge time.
//
// -verify (default false) recounts each window from
// stellar.account_movements right after it's processed (whether or
// not -write persisted anything new this run) and compares per-
// movement_kind counts against what THIS run's decode produced for
// that window — a cheap, window-scoped reconciliation (ADR-0047 D4
// applied to the CH write target), not full ADR-0033 machinery.
// Mismatches are logged loudly but non-fatal; the final summary
// reports the total.
//
// -to is HARD-CLAMPED below classicMovementsP23StartLedger regardless
// of what the operator passes — loudly, via a stderr warning, never
// silently. This is the one enforcement point for ADR-0047 D2's
// "historical-only" invariant; nothing upstream (the decoder, the CH
// reader) knows about the P23 boundary at all.
