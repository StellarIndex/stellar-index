// ContiguousWatermark returns the highest ledger L such that stellar.ledgers
// contains every ledger in [from, L] with NO hole — i.e. the lake is provably
// complete from `from` up to L. It is the real-time projector's safe upper read
// bound when reading forward events from CH (ADR-0034 #10 feed-switch).
//
// Why it's needed: the live dual-sink (LiveSink) is best-effort — it DROPS whole
// ledgers under buffer pressure and a flush can partially fail — so CH can have
// holes near the tip. The projector advances its per-source cursor to the upper
// bound unconditionally (to skip event-free stretches), so reading past a hole
// would silently lose that ledger's protocol events. Clamping the upper bound to
// this watermark makes the projector stall AT a hole until the catch-up timer
// heals it, rather than skipping over it.
//
// Completeness is keyed off the ledgers table, which is a per-ledger commit
// marker: Sink.Flush writes stellar.ledgers LAST, so a ledger_seq present there
// guarantees that ledger's contract_events (and all other tables) are already
// durable. A buffer-full drop drops the whole extract, so it leaves no ledgers
// row either — either way "present in ledgers" ⟹ "complete in CH".
//
// Returns from-1 when CH has not yet reached `from` (nothing complete to read);
// callers treat tip <= from as idle.
