// here would require either an integration-style harness against
// a real timescale.Store (covered downstream once #557 lands and
// the integration tests can hit the real schema) or a mockable
// store interface. The flusher's logic is small and well-typed;
// the dispatcher.Stats package + storage package each have their
// own tests that pin the inputs/outputs.
//
// Future: when timescale.Store grows a mock-friendly interface,
// add direct flushAt tests with a fake clock + injected stats.
