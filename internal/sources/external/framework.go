// Package external houses the connector framework for off-chain data
// sources — centralised exchanges (Binance, Kraken, Bitstamp, Coinbase,
// …), institutional FX feeds (Polygon.io, OANDA), third-party
// aggregators (CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, CryptoCompare), and
// sovereign daily anchors (ECB, Fed H.10).
//
// Contrast with the on-chain dispatcher at internal/dispatcher/: that
// package consumes xdr.LedgerCloseMeta from Galexie and routes events
// to event- / op- / contract-call decoders. External sources speak
// HTTPS / WebSocket to vendor APIs on their own cadence, so they live
// outside the ledger loop. Both converge on the same canonical types
// (canonical.Trade, canonical.OracleUpdate) and the same Timescale
// hypertables — only the arrival path differs.
//
// Three orthogonal capabilities per source. A venue implements
// whichever subset it actually supports:
//
//   - [Streamer]     — live WebSocket trade feed (exchange class)
//   - [Poller]       — periodic REST fetch (aggregator / FX / sovereign)
//   - [Backfiller]   — historical OHLC candles via a venue's REST
//     endpoint; synthesised to canonical.Trade per bucket
//
// Sources that only stream live implement Streamer; sources that poll
// quote-boards implement Poller; a source can implement all three.
// Backfiller is always optional — Kraken caps historical at 720
// intervals (~30 days at 1h), Fed H.10 is daily-only, etc.
//
// Source class metadata lives in [Registry] — a Go-map source of truth
// that the aggregator queries at VWAP compute time to decide
// contribution (ClassExchange = yes, ClassAggregator / ClassOracle /
// ClassAuthoritySanity = no). No database table at this scale; swap
// to DB when the list outgrows a single Go file.
