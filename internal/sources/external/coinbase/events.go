// Package coinbase streams live trade matches from Coinbase
// Exchange's public WebSocket feed. Adds US price discovery for
// XLM/USD — a venue missing from our reference implementation
// (`~/code/rates`), so this is the net-new connector in the Phase-2
// CEX fleet.
//
// Venue-naming note: Coinbase has two distinct API families —
// Coinbase Exchange (the ex-Pro API; public, public-key auth for
// private data, no auth for matches/ticker) and Coinbase Advanced
// Trade (the retail-facing new surface; OAuth, rate-limited for
// non-authenticated use). We target **Exchange** — it's the stable
// institutional-grade feed used by most market-data consumers and
// matches the capability profile of Binance/Kraken/Bitstamp.
//
// Architectural contrast with prior CEXes:
//
//   - Symbol format: "XLM-USD" (dash), between Kraken's "XLM/USD"
//     and Binance's "XLMUSD".
//   - Subscribe shape: `{"type":"subscribe","channels":[{"name":
//     "matches","product_ids":[...]}]}` — one message covers all
//     product IDs.
//   - The `matches` channel publishes executed trades (not quote
//     updates). On subscribe Coinbase also sends one `last_match`
//     per product to prime consumer state — treated as a real
//     historical trade, identical shape to live matches.
//   - Numbers arrive as strings natively — no json.Number dance.
//   - Time is RFC 3339 with nanosecond precision.
//
// Wire format reference:
// https://docs.cloud.coinbase.com/exchange/docs/websocket-channels
