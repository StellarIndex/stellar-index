// Package blend ingests events from the Blend Capital Soroban
// lending protocol on Stellar.
//
// Per docs/discovery/dexes-amms/blend.md: Blend is **not** a spot
// trading venue. We index it for:
//
//  1. Liquidation auctions — directional price signals during
//     stress; collateral sold at a discount to cover bad debt.
//  2. Money-market positions (supply / withdraw / borrow / repay /
//     flash_loan) — supply-side metrics for asset detail pages.
//  3. Credit-risk events (bad_debt, defaulted_debt) — protocol
//     health.
//  4. Admin / status (set_admin, update_pool, set_status) —
//     operational state for degraded-source detection.
//
// **We do NOT emit Blend events as canonical.Trade.** Blend's
// outputs are auctions and position changes, not spot trades. The
// dispatcher routes Blend events through the [Decoder]; the
// indexer-side sink writes them to per-protocol Blend storage
// (auctions, positions, admin) rather than the trades hypertable.
//
// Blend is in the price-aggregation
// scope but only as a "secondary validation source" — auction
// stress-prices contribute as reference points
// on the asset detail surface, not into VWAP.
//
// Verified 2026-04-22 against pool/src/events.rs +
// pool-factory/src/events.rs at clone time of
// .discovery-repos/blend-contracts.
