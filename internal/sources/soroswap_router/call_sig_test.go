// TestCallSig is the regression guard for the migration-0056 PK discriminator.
// CallSig must: (1) be deterministic, (2) IGNORE deadline (so auth-tree dups of
// the same call dedup even if a sentinel deadline varies), and (3) DIFFER for
// any economically-distinct swap (recipient / path / amount) — the 106 router
// swaps that the coarse PK was collapsing. A regression in any of these silently
// re-introduces sub-op data loss or double-counts dedupable dups.
