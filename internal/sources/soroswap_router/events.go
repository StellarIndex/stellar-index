// Package soroswap_router decodes Soroban InvokeContract calls
// against the Soroswap Router contract. The router emits no events
// itself (its work is calling down to per-pair contracts that
// emit `SoroswapPair("swap")`); this package observes the router's
// invocation directly via dispatcher.ContractCallDecoder so we
// capture user-level intent (path, amount_in, amount_out_min)
// distinct from the per-pair leg-level swaps.
//
// Sister package: internal/sources/soroswap (pair + factory event
// decoder). Same upstream protocol; different vantage point.
