// Decoder is the OpDecoder for pre-P23 classic-movement
// reconstruction (ADR-0047 D2). It mirrors sdex.Decoder's shape
// (SDEX is the established precedent for a classic-op decoder that
// lives OUTSIDE the projector) but, unlike SDEX, is NEVER registered
// with the live dispatcher — see the package doc for why. It is
// wired only into `stellarindex-ops classic-movements-backfill`,
// which streams clickhouse.ClassicOp values (via StreamClassicOps)
// and feeds them through Decode as a dispatcher.OpContext, exactly
// as ch-rebuild's SDEX pass does with clickhouse.SDEXOp.
//
// Stateful since Phase 3: claiming or clawing back a
// CreateClaimableBalance needs that create's Asset/Amount, which
// neither op carries directly (only the BalanceId — research §2's
// "b+own-index" path). balances is an in-RUN index (populated as
// this Decoder's own Decode calls observe 'claimable_balance_create'
// movements — see decodeOp's caller in Decode below) that resolves
// same-run claims/clawbacks for free; pending collects the ones this
// index can't resolve (create out of this run's range, or landed in
// a not-yet-visited window — see doc.go's ordering caveat) for the
// caller to resolve via a second-pass ClickHouse lookup (ADR-0048 D2;
// previously Postgres) — see
// TakePendingClaimableBalances / ResolvePendingClaimableBalance.
//
// The in-memory index is BOUNDED at maxCBIndexEntries (FIFO eviction,
// oldest create evicted first) — a genesis-to-P23 run in a single
// invocation would otherwise accumulate on the order of the full
// CreateClaimableBalance row count (research §5: ~1.5B) before ever
// being claimed, which is what drove an earlier OOM. Eviction is safe
// because a miss here is not data loss: ResolveBalance failing just
// means the pending entry falls through to
// clickhouse.FindClaimableBalanceCreates, classic-movements-backfill's
// ClickHouse-backed second pass (batched across a whole window's
// misses, not one query per ref), which resolves any create this run
// has itself already written — the same fallback path used for
// creates outside this run's range entirely. Operators backfilling
// Phase 3 should still chunk `-from`/`-to` into multi-million-ledger
// invocations (same heavy-job discipline as every other backfill in
// this repo): the bound protects against OOM, but a smaller working
// set keeps more claims resolving from the free in-memory path
// instead of paying a ClickHouse round trip.
//
// Not safe for concurrent Decode calls — sequential caller only,
// matching dispatcher.Dispatcher's own "not safe for concurrent
// ProcessLedger" contract. classic-movements-backfill's loop is
// single-threaded, so this is never an issue in practice.
