// Package defindex decodes Soroban contract events emitted by both
// layers of paltalabs' DeFindex protocol on Stellar mainnet:
//
//  1. STRATEGY layer — Blend autocompound *strategy* contracts that
//     hold the underlying lending position. Topic[0] =
//     ScvString("BlendStrategy"). Body { from: Address, amount: i128 }.
//     `from` here is the VAULT contract (a C-strkey), not the end
//     user — useful for capital-flow attribution between layers.
//
//  2. VAULT layer — DeFindex *vault wrapper* contracts that users
//     interact with directly. Topic[0] = ScvString("DeFindexVault").
//     Body has the end-user G-strkey (`depositor` / `withdrawer`),
//     multi-asset amounts (`amounts` / `amounts_withdrawn`,
//     Vec<i128>) and share-token deltas (`df_tokens_minted` /
//     `df_tokens_burned`, i128).
//
// Phase A (2026-05-19) shipped only the strategy layer because the
// initial WASM walk confirmed only the strategy WASM
// (`11329c24…988`) on the 3 named "fixed strategy" vault contracts
// in `mainnet.contracts.json`. That walk MISSED the wrapper
// contracts deployed by the factory (different WASM `ae3409a4…468b`
// or its upgraded `07097f83…84b0`); we now know there are 100+
// such wrappers spawned over the protocol's life (factory
// `CDKFHFJI…NFKI` emits one `create` event per spawn). The vault
// wrappers ARE where end-user attribution lives, and missing them
// is what the 2026-05-21 cross-check vs Soroban RPC revealed
// (~27% coverage in a 12-hour sample; pre-rc.63 walker only 14%).
//
// Phase B (this revision, 2026-05-21) adds the DeFindexVault
// topic-match. Dispatch is still PURELY by topic — we don't
// hardcode any contract addresses — so any current or future
// DeFindex vault wrapper, whether listed in mainnet.contracts.json
// or spawned later, gets decoded automatically. This mirrors the
// comet/aquarius shared-emitter topology elsewhere in the codebase.
//
// We surface vault + strategy deposit/withdraw events for flow
// attribution only — they are NOT price-discovery events and never
// contribute to VWAP. Out of scope here: factory `create`/`n_fee`
// events, strategy `harvest` events, vault `rebalance`/admin events
// — all flagged in docs/operations/wasm-audits/defindex.md as
// Phase-B-or-later follow-ups.
//
// See README.md for scope.
