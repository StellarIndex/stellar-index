// Package comet decodes on-chain events from Comet — a Soroban

// Wire shape, verified 2026-04-23 against the public contract source
// (comet-contracts-v1/contracts/src/c_pool/event.rs and
// call_logic/pool.rs:21,184-191; re-verified 2026-05-26 against
// upstream `main` for the join/exit/deposit/withdraw additions):
//
//	topic[0] = Symbol("POOL")
//	topic[1] = Symbol("<event_name>")
//	body     = Map { … }      (shape per event)
//
// The Soroban port emits exactly **five** events under the shared
// `POOL` namespace:
//
//   - "swap"       — caller, token_in, token_out,
//     token_amount_in, token_amount_out
//     → emits a canonical.Trade
//   - "join_pool"  — caller, token_in, token_amount_in
//     → emits a LiquidityEvent (multi-token LP add;
//     one event per token, so an N-token join
//     produces N rows)
//   - "exit_pool"  — caller, token_out, token_amount_out
//     → emits a LiquidityEvent (multi-token LP remove)
//   - "deposit"    — caller, token_in, token_amount_in
//     → emits a LiquidityEvent (single-asset LP add)
//   - "withdraw"   — caller, token_out, token_amount_out,
//     pool_amount_in
//     → emits a LiquidityEvent (single-asset LP remove;
//     pool_amount_in is the BPT-share count burned)
//
// What's **not** emitted by the Soroban port (despite being in
// Balancer-v1 on EVM):
//
//   - bind / rebind / unbind / finalize — these functions do not
//     exist in the Soroban port. The pool's token+weight set is
//     fixed at `init()` and there is no event published.
//   - set_swap_fee / set_public_swap — neither function exists.
//   - set_controller — exists, but does not publish an event in the
//     Soroban port (a contract upgrade that adds one would surface
//     as a new (POOL, set_controller) topic; the decoder rejects
//     it with ErrNotCometEvent until support is added).
//   - gulp — exists (absorbs tokens sent directly to the contract),
//     does not publish an event.
//
// BPT (Balancer Pool Token) transfers ARE emitted, but via the
// **SEP-41 standard token-event surface**, not the POOL namespace.
// They are claimed by the SEP-41 supply observer
// (internal/sources/sep41_supply) when the pool contract is in its
// registered scope; this package does not re-decode them.
//
// `POOL` is a shared topic namespace across every Comet pool contract
// — the decoder matches by topic bytes, not pool contract ID, same
// pattern as Soroswap/Aquarius/Phoenix. Operators who want narrow
// coverage (e.g. only Blend's backstop) filter downstream by
// `Trade.Source == "comet"` or `LiquidityEvent.ContractID`, not at
// dispatch time.
