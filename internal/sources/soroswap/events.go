// Pre-encoded base64 SCVal::Symbol("<event>") blobs — these are
// what stellar-rpc emits in event.topic[0] and what we'll pass as
// the filter topic to subscribe server-side. Pre-computing them
// avoids round-tripping every event through an XDR decoder just to
// classify it.
//
// These are intentionally **placeholder strings** until the real
// XDR-SCVal encoder lands (see TODO(#0)). Matching against a
// placeholder never produces a match against a real event stream
// — which is fine: the consumer is unit-tested with these placeholders,
// and wiring to real stellar-rpc is blocked on the same SDK dependency
// decision that unblocks proper SCVal encoding.
//
// Regeneration (future): `stellar-cli ... scval encode <SYMBOL>` or
// via the go-stellar-sdk's `xdr.NewSymbol`.
//
// Uniqueness is enforced by the compiler — a `switch` with duplicate
// `case` values fails to compile. That's our canary against
// accidentally setting two placeholders to the same value.
