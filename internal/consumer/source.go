// Source is the uniform interface every ingestion source implements.
//
// Implementations live under internal/sources/<name>/. The
// orchestrator in cmd/ratesengine-indexer holds a registry of
// configured Source values and drives them via BackfillRange +
// StreamLive.
//
// Event is the empty interface on purpose — actual shapes
// (canonical.Trade, canonical.PriceObservation, canonical.LPState)
// come from internal/canonical. We use a tagged sum there rather
// than a type-switch here, keeping this interface generic across
// the many source flavours.
//
// Errors from these methods are fatal for the specific source
// invocation; the orchestrator logs + restarts after a backoff.
// Transient per-event parse failures never bubble up — they
// are counted as metrics and logged with structured fields.

	// that). The orchestrator's cursor persister reads this to
	// checkpoint where we've progressed to; on restart we resume
	// from here.
	//
	// Zero means the source hasn't yet processed any events this
	// session — the orchestrator keeps the last-persisted cursor
	// rather than checkpointing a regression.
	LastLedger uint32

	// LagLedgers is how many ledgers behind the current tip we

	LagLedgers uint32

	// LastError, if non-nil, is the most recent error observed.
	// The orchestrator resets this on successful reconnect.
