//     replay window — generous for the typical 30s reconnect blip
//     and enough for a multi-minute network outage.
//   - At the 5s tip cadence (/v1/price/tip/stream): ~21 minutes,
//     comfortable for short reconnect storms.

// At 4 KiB per Event the buffer is ~1 MiB per topic — fine even with
// hundreds of topics.
