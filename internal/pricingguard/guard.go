// Package pricingguard is the serving-sanity guard shared by every raw
// prices_1m closed-bucket serving path across the API and aggregator
// binaries (adversarial-review HIGH).
//
// Several serving paths read the most-recent CLOSED prices_1m bucket
// directly via [timescale.Store.LatestClosedVWAP1mForPair] — a bare
// Σ(quote)/Σ(base) continuous-aggregate bucket that BYPASSES the
// orchestrator's σ-outlier filter, its min-USD-volume gate, and freeze
// value-protection (those guard the ORCHESTRATOR path that writes the
// filtered VWAP to Redis, which the CAGG does not touch). So each such
// path carries the identical unfiltered fat-finger / manipulation vector:
// a single manipulated print in the served minute would otherwise be
// served verbatim, with stale=false and no volume floor. The three known
// raw-bucket consumers are:
//
//   - /v1/price               (cmd/stellarindex-api storePriceReader.LatestPrice)
//   - /v1/assets/{slug}        (cmd/stellarindex-api globalPriceReader.LatestVWAP, GlobalAssetView headline)
//   - the price-alert evaluator (cmd/stellarindex-aggregator priceAlertVWAPReader.LatestVWAP)
//
// This package hosts the WIRING that turns the pure robust-band decision
// ([aggregate.GuardServedVWAP], ADR-0003 exact-rational) into a servable
// row: it fetches the trailing baseline and, on a gross deviation, swaps
// the candidate for the newest clean last-known-good bucket. It lives
// ABOVE the storage tier (it depends on the store) and above the pure
// aggregate decision (which cannot depend on storage — timescale already
// imports aggregate, so the reverse edge would cycle). A dedicated package
// lets BOTH binaries import it without duplicating the glue.
