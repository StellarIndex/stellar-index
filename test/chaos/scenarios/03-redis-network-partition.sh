# Scenario 03 — Network-partition the Redis container (without
# stopping it) and assert the API's rate-limit middleware fails open
# rather than 5xx-ing every request.
#
# This differs from 01 (full stop) by exercising the timeout path
# rather than the connection-refused path. They hit different go-redis
# code branches and historically a regression in one didn't surface in
# the other.
#
# Pass criteria:
#   1. Pre-partition: API is healthy.
#   2. During partition (60s): API healthz still 200; rate-limited
#      paths still serve (fail-open).
#   3. Post-heal: API stays healthy (no lingering bad-conn pool state).
#
# Tooling preference: pumba (`netem` ingress drop). Falls back to
# `docker network disconnect` when pumba isn't installed — this is
# heavier-handed but exercises the same cold-conn path.
