# Scenario 02 — Timescale is killed; assert the API fails LOUDLY
# (no silent stale data) and recovers cleanly when storage returns.
#
# Storage is the source-of-truth — when it's gone, /v1/price MUST
# either:
#   a) Serve a still-fresh cached value (Redis hit + recent write)
#      with no claim of authority, OR
#   b) Return 5xx with a structured envelope.
#
# A silent fall-through to "0.000" or empty data would be the
# nightmare scenario. This scenario verifies that doesn't happen.
#
# Pass criteria:
#   1. While Timescale is down, /v1/healthz returns 200 OR 503 (the
#      latter is correct when readyz checks DB connectivity).
#   2. While Timescale is down, /v1/markets returns either a 200
#      (Redis cache hit) or 5xx — NOT 200 with empty data.
#   3. After Timescale restart, /v1/healthz returns 200 within 60s.
#
# Runbook: docs/operations/runbooks/timescale-primary-down.md
# (covers production HA case; this scenario verifies the dev stack's
# behaviour without HA — fail-loud is the contract).
