# Architecture Decision Records

Every significant architectural choice in Stellar Index is captured
here as an **ADR** — a numbered, dated, immutable record.

## Rules

1. **Immutable.** Once an ADR is `Accepted`, its body is never
   edited for content. Typo fixes and formatting are allowed; rationale
   is not.
2. **Supersede, don't rewrite.** If a decision changes, write a new
   ADR that supersedes the old one, and add one line to the old ADR's
   metadata:

   ```yaml
   superseded_by: 0017
   ```

3. **Numbered sequentially.** ADR-0001, ADR-0002, … No renumbering.
   Gaps are allowed when a number has been reserved for a planned
   ADR that hasn't been written yet — list it in the index below
   with status *Planned* and the doc/ref that depends on it, so the
   reservation is visible and the number isn't silently re-used.
4. **One topic per ADR.** Don't bundle.
5. **Every PR that makes an architectural decision includes an ADR.**
   Review-gate: ADR + code together or neither.

## Status values

- `Proposed` — under discussion; safe to move to `Accepted` only
  after the PR lands.
- `Accepted` — in force. Code adheres.
- `Superseded` — replaced by a later ADR; pointer in metadata.
- `Rejected` — proposed and explicitly turned down; kept so we don't
  re-litigate the same idea.

## Template

See [_template.md](_template.md) for the boilerplate.
