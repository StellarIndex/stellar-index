| ID | Severity | Title | Affected Surface | Evidence | Status | Owner | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| F-1201 | critical | R1 exposes internal storage, observability, and admin services publicly while both nftables and UFW are inactive | R1 host firewall; Ansible archival-node firewall; MinIO/Prometheus/Loki/Promtail/node_exporter/Galexie | XFI-0001; R1-0005; R1-0006; R1-0008; EV-0019 | open | ops/security | External TCP connections succeeded to internal-service ports that repo config says should be default-deny or internal-only. |
| F-1202 | high | Source API contract and deployed R1 API disagreed for removed `/v1/coins` and `/v1/currencies` surfaces | API route table; R1 deployed binary; generated API artifacts | XFI-0002; EV-0012; EV-0020; EV-0066; R1-0001 | fixed | api/release | Current R1 now returns 404 for all removed legacy routes, matching source. Keep the historical evidence because it existed earlier in the same audit window; the live mismatch itself is no longer open. |
| F-1203 | high | Generated explorer API types remain stale and local docs verification did not catch it | `web/explorer/src/api/types.ts`; generation/docs CI | XFI-0002; EV-0007; EV-0011; EV-0013; EV-0067 | open | api/web/ci | On current `HEAD`, docs YAML regenerates cleanly, but `pnpm generate:api` still produces a 362-line diff in explorer TS types, including dashboard webhook routes and updated legacy-route wording. |
| F-1204 | medium | Public API audit tooling and machine-facing docs still advertise removed `/v1/coins` and `/v1/currencies` routes | `scripts/dev/audit-public-api.sh`; `web/explorer/public/llms.txt` | XFI-0002; EV-0065; EV-0066 | open | web/api/docs | Live explorer/status and smoke consumers were migrated, but the public audit script still fails 5 checks against current R1 and `llms.txt` still advertises `GET /v1/coins`. |
| F-1205 | high | R1 is missing SLA, archive-integrity, and supply evidence timers that repo monitoring/runbooks expect | R1 systemd; `deploy/systemd/*`; monitoring rules; runbooks | XFI-0003; R1-0002; R1-0003; R1-0004 | open | ops | Only smoke and heartbeat timers from Rates Engine are installed; evidence-producing timers are absent. |
| F-1206 | high | Public launch readiness gate fails despite canonical local verify passing | `scripts/ci/verify-launch-ready`; `Makefile`; launch readiness docs | XFI-0004; EV-0009; EV-0013 | open | release/ops | Cross-region, security-review, failover-chaos, and finalisation blockers remain red. |
| F-1207 | critical | All three public web apps pin vulnerable `next@15.0.4` and CI/Dependabot do not cover pnpm advisories | `web/*/package.json`; `.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `.github/dependabot.yml`; hosted GitHub dependency alerts | XFI-0005; EV-0014; EV-0051 | open | web/security | `pnpm audit` reports 2 critical and 8 high advisories per app; Dependabot has gomod/actions/docker only, CI has no pnpm audit step, and hosted GitHub vulnerability/Dependabot alerts are disabled. |
| F-1208 | high | Multiple enabled ingestion sources are stopped or throttled on R1 while API health remains green | R1 indexer/Prometheus/API readiness | XFI-0006; R1-0001; R1-0009; R1-0010 | open | ingestion/ops | Prometheus shows firing source-stopped alerts for ECB/Soroswap/Band/Phoenix and pending alerts for Comet/Blend/Redstone; Coingecko 429s repeat in logs. |
| F-1209 | medium | R1 host capacity is already under memory/swap pressure and MinIO is 78% full | R1 host capacity; infra alerts; storage runbooks | XFI-0006; R1-0007; R1-0010 | open | ops | Memory alert is firing at about 95.41%, swap is full, and MinIO has 4.9T of 6.4T used. |
| F-1210 | medium | API `/healthz` and `/readyz` scope is too narrow for launch/SLA truth | API health endpoints; status semantics; monitoring | XFI-0006; R1-0009; R1-0010 | open | api/ops | Health/ready only report process/postgres/redis ok while material ingest, latency, memory, and timer evidence failures are active. |
| F-1211 | medium | Status-page incident docs and comms templates point to removed Upptime/cstate workflows instead of the shipped Cloudflare Pages app | `web/status`; `deploy/status-page`; operations runbooks; comms templates | XFI-0007; EV-0021 | open | ops/comms/web | During a SEV, the binding runbook tells operators to edit absent `deploy/status-page/cstate/**` files or use Upptime issues, while the repo ships `web/status` as a custom Next.js static export. |
| F-1212 | high | Free dashboard accounts can self-mint API keys with paid-tier rate limits up to 100,000 requests/minute | Dashboard key management; platform API keys; auth validator; rate-limit middleware | XFI-0008; EV-0023; EV-0089 | fixed | dashboard/billing/api | Current `HEAD` now clamps dashboard-minted key budgets by account tier before insert and tests the tier ladder, so the privilege-escalation path no longer reproduces. |
| F-1213 | high | Stablecoin fiat proxy undercounts Stellar USD volume by 10x in the min-volume manipulation gate | Aggregator stablecoin proxy; Stellar DEX quote decimals; `aggregate.min_usd_volume`; R1 aggregator config | XFI-0009; EV-0024; R1-0011 | open | aggregate/market-data | Classic/SAC USDC quotes are 7-decimal, but `windowUSDVolume` always divides quote amounts by 1e8 for fiat-USD windows; R1 currently avoids false drops only by setting `min_usd_volume=0`, disabling the threshold. |
| F-1214 | critical | `main` is unprotected, so required CI, CODEOWNER review, and signed commits are not enforced | GitHub branch protection/rulesets; `CONTRIBUTING.md`; `CODEOWNERS`; release process | XFI-0010; EV-0025; EV-0026 | open | repo-admin/security | GitHub reports `main.protected=false`; branch protection/rulesets are unavailable on the current private repo tier, contradicting local policy docs and removing the merge gate for production code. |
| F-1215 | high | Production deployment environments have no required reviewers despite holding deploy secrets | GitHub environments; `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`; Cloudflare Pages deploy workflows; repo Actions secrets | XFI-0010; EV-0025; EV-0026 | open | repo-admin/ops | `r1`, docs, explorer, status, and GitHub Pages environments have empty protection rules and admin bypass enabled; manual deployment jobs can access production secrets without environment approval. |
| F-1216 | high | GitHub Actions allows all third-party actions without SHA pinning while workflows use tag-pinned actions | GitHub Actions repository policy; `.github/workflows/*.yml` | XFI-0010; EV-0025; EV-0026 | open | repo-admin/security | Hosted Actions policy has `allowed_actions=all` and `sha_pinning_required=false`; workflows invoke many external actions by mutable version tags, including deployment and release paths. |
| F-1217 | high | SEP-10 replay protection is optional and can run guard-free when Redis is absent | SEP-10 validator; API startup wiring; auth token endpoint; bearer auth | XFI-0011; EV-0027; EV-0053; EV-0096; R1-0012 | fixed | api/security | Current workspace now fails API startup when `auth_mode=sep10` is selected without Redis, so the guard-free deployment path no longer reproduces. |
| F-1218 | high | Public signup can mint immediately usable 1000/min API keys from unverified emails and non-atomic duplicate checks | `/v1/signup`; signup tracker; API key store; signup UI/OpenAPI | XFI-0012; EV-0028 | open | api/security/billing | Attackers can script unique emails, missing tracker deployments, or concurrent same-email races to mint many Starter keys without email ownership proof or billing gate. |
| F-1219 | high | Stripe paid-upgrade webhook still bypasses platform subscription and dashboard-key sources of truth | Stripe webhook; Redis API keys; Postgres platform billing/API keys | XFI-0013; EV-0030; EV-0053 | open | billing/platform/api | Current source has Postgres Stripe event dedupe/audit wiring, but the webhook still mutates only Redis keys by `client_reference_id`; subscriptions, accounts, and Postgres dashboard keys are not upgraded. |
| F-1220 | high | Tagged deploys can restart schema-dependent binaries without shipping or applying matching migrations | Release/deploy workflow; Ansible binary deploy; migrations; R1 schema state | XFI-0014; EV-0031; R1-0013 | open | release/ops/db | The production deploy path downloads and swaps binaries only; migration sync/apply is an initial bring-up/manual step, and there is no schema-compatibility readiness gate. |
| F-1221 | medium | Release/deploy docs still claim GHCR container image publishing that the current release workflow explicitly removed | Release workflow; release/deploy docs; Docker image expectations | XFI-0014; EV-0032 | open | docs/release | Operators and self-hosters are told to expect GHCR artifacts that the workflow intentionally no longer produces. |
| F-1222 | medium | Rollback docs point operators to nonexistent `/opt/ratesengine/release-<tag>` directories instead of actual binary backups | Release process runbook; Ansible deploy backup layout; R1 sidecars | XFI-0014; EV-0032; R1-0013 | open | ops/release | Incident fallback rollback can fail because the documented artifact path is not produced by the current deploy task. |
| F-1223 | high | R1 runs a stale Caddyfile that exposes `/metrics` publicly and collapses Cloudflare client IPs to edge IPs | Caddy reverse proxy; API trusted proxy config; public observability boundary | XFI-0015; EV-0033; R1-0014 | open | ops/security | Source Caddy blocks `/metrics` and forwards `{client_ip}` after Cloudflare CIDR validation; R1 forwards `{remote_host}` and public `/metrics` returns HTTP 200 with internal Prometheus metrics. |
| F-1224 | medium | Dashboard magic-link and session audit IP fields record proxy/loopback IPs instead of real client IPs | Dashboard auth handlers; session middleware; platform token/user stores; Caddy/API proxying | XFI-0016; EV-0034; R1-0014 | open | dashboard/security | Login/security audit fields intended for IP/new-country signals parse `r.RemoteAddr` directly instead of the middleware-resolved remote IP. |
| F-1225 | high | `/v1/history/since-inception` returns empty XLM/USD history while chart and direct USDC history have data | Historical price APIs; stablecoin USD fallback; Timescale CAGG readers | XFI-0017; EV-0035; R1-0015 | open | api/market-data | Since-inception reads only literal `native/fiat:USD`; it lacks the configured USD-pegged stablecoin fallback used by chart/price/VWAP/TWAP/OHLC surfaces. |
| F-1226 | high | Dashboard API-key allowlists, permissions, monthly quotas, and usage fields are accepted but not enforced at runtime | Platform API keys; dashboard key UI/API; auth validator; rate/quota enforcement | XFI-0018; EV-0036 | open | platform/api/security | Key records carry policy fields, but the authenticated request path propagates only identity/tier/rate-limit and never checks allowlists, referer, permissions, monthly quotas, or last-used updates. |
| F-1227 | medium | The `ratesengine-migrate` container cannot apply bundled migrations out of the box | Docker migrate image; migration binary; self-hosting docs | XFI-0019; EV-0037 | open | docker/db | Runtime image copies only the binary while the binary defaults to a missing `migrations` directory. |
| F-1228 | high | SSE streams are cut off after 30 seconds by the API server write timeout | API HTTP server; SSE stream endpoints; R1 live API | XFI-0020; EV-0038; R1-0016 | open | api/streaming/ops | R1 tip stream closes at elapsed 30s despite 5s events and 15s heartbeats. |
| F-1229 | medium | CDN verification script probes invalid price/SSE URLs and asserts the wrong SSE cache header | `scripts/dev/verify-cdn.sh`; price/tip API; SSE headers | XFI-0021; EV-0039 | open | ops/api | Script uses `base=` where handlers require `asset=` and expects `no-store` while SSE sets `no-cache`. |
| F-1230 | high | R1 `since-inception` history for core XLM/USDC starts on 2026-05-03, not one year or inception | Historical API; backfill; R1 data depth | XFI-0022; EV-0040; R1-0017 | open | data/backfill/api | Direct XLM/Circle-USDC daily history has only nine buckets. |
| F-1231 | high | Canonical CI is PR-only while `main` is unprotected, so direct pushes can bypass full verification | GitHub CI triggers; branch protection; release governance | XFI-0023; EV-0041; EV-0025 | open | repo-admin/ci | Full `ci` does not run on main pushes, but hosted branch protection does not enforce the PR-only assumption. |
| F-1232 | high | Circle USDC has `price_usd` on asset detail but 404s or disappears from `/v1/price` and batch price APIs | Price API; batch API; asset detail price enrichment | XFI-0024; EV-0042; R1-0018 | open | api/market-data | Asset detail returns USDC USD price, but single price 404s and batch returns an empty array for the same asset. |
| F-1233 | high | SDEX historical backfill silently drops legacy V0 claim atoms while claiming genesis coverage | SDEX decoder; dispatcher metrics; historical backfill | XFI-0025; EV-0044 | open | ingest/backfill/sdex | Legacy V0 claim atoms are rejected then suppressed inside the source adapter, so old SDEX fills disappear without decode-error metrics. |
| F-1234 | medium | Oracle decoders silently skip unknown feeds inside mixed batches, hiding upstream coverage drift | Reflector/Redstone/Band decoders; canonical allow-lists; decoder metrics | XFI-0026; EV-0045 | open | oracle/coverage/observability | New oracle-supported assets can be omitted from stored oracle rows without decode-error metrics as long as the same event contains at least one known asset. |
| F-1235 | medium | External CEX stream parser errors are skipped without the decode-error metrics promised by runbooks | Binance/Kraken/Bitstamp/Coinbase streamers; external metrics; decode-error runbook | XFI-0027; EV-0046 | open | external/observability | Vendor frame/schema drift can drop live trades while `SourceDecodeErrorsTotal` stays clean. |
| F-1236 | high | Supply snapshots can be stamped at a fresh ledger while using stale component observations | Supply refreshers; supply observer storage; asset supply API/market-cap fields | XFI-0028; EV-0047 | open | supply/data-quality | Snapshot ledger is the max ingestion cursor, but component readers use latest-at-or-before rows without freshness checks. |
| F-1237 | medium | CoinMarketCap polling ignores verified CMC IDs and can bind ambiguous tickers to the wrong asset | Verified currency catalogue; CMC poller; external aggregator observations | XFI-0029; EV-0048 | open | external/identity | The poller queries CMC by ticker and takes the first duplicate-ticker result even though the catalogue stores numeric CMC IDs. |
| F-1238 | medium | Redis-less API deployments fail startup because closed-bucket stream subscriber is gated on Hub, not Redis | API startup; Redis optionality; closed-bucket SSE stream | XFI-0030; EV-0054; EV-0096 | fixed | api/streaming/ops | Current workspace now gates the Redis pub/sub subscriber on `rdb != nil && hub != nil`, so Redis-less API startup no longer aborts on subscriber construction. |
| F-1239 | medium | WASM history and extraction ops tools panic at completion when progress output is disabled | `ratesengine-ops` WASM audit/extraction commands; Soroban coverage evidence | XFI-0031; EV-0055 | open | ops/data-quality | `-progress-every 0` suppresses in-loop progress but completion still computes modulo by zero after the ledger walk. |
| F-1240 | medium | Docker images build with a different Go toolchain than CI/release while docs claim binary equivalence | Dockerfiles; Go module pin; CI/release workflows; self-hosted image builds | XFI-0032; EV-0057 | open | docker/release | All Dockerfiles use `golang:1.26-alpine`; CI/release use `go.mod` `1.25.10`, and Docker docs still claim `golang:1.25-alpine` and release-equivalent binaries. |
| F-1241 | medium | The operator migration index stops at `0015` even though the repository ships dense schema history through `0029` | `migrations/README.md`; migration review/deploy/runbook workflows | XFI-0033; EV-0058; EV-0059 | open | db/docs/ops | The README claims to be the current migration inventory and says to update it on every new migration, but it omits fourteen live migration families that materially change schema and operational expectations. |
| F-1242 | medium | The live contribution-history sink persists rows with `volume_usd=NULL` even though the schema reserves that field for source-transparency UX | Aggregator contribution sink; contribution schema/storage; future source-breakdown API/UI | XFI-0034; EV-0060 | open | aggregate/storage/product | The binary writes contribution rows today, but the adapter never forwards USD volume into the durable row shape, so historical source-level USD contribution data is already missing. |
| F-1243 | high | Classic-asset registry freshness and observation counts freeze after the first same-process trade for an asset | Trade insert registry hook; `classic_assets`; issuer/asset catalogue ranking and detail metadata | XFI-0035; EV-0062 | open | storage/assets/data-quality | The dedupe cache exits before the upsert that should update first/last seen ledgers and increment observations, so a long-running ingest/backfill process leaves registry metadata stale until restart. |
| F-1244 | high | Dashboard webhook signing secrets are persisted as live HMAC keys while docs and type names claim hash-only / never-persisted semantics | Dashboard webhook create path; Postgres webhook store; outbound worker signing | XFI-0036; EV-0068 | open | security/platform/webhooks | A database read of `customer_webhooks.secret_hash` yields the actual signing key bytes the worker uses, contrary to the published secret-handling contract. |
| F-1245 | high | Customer webhook URLs create an outbound SSRF primitive because validation enforces only `https://` and the worker follows default redirects | Dashboard webhook URL validation; outbound delivery worker; API process egress boundary | XFI-0037; EV-0069; EV-0096 | fixed | security/platform/webhooks | Current workspace now validates internal/private destinations at registration, re-resolves before delivery, and disables redirect following in the worker client. |
| F-1246 | medium | API design docs still say webhook callbacks are not in v1 even though dashboard webhook CRUD, worker, and runbooks have shipped | API design reference; webhook OpenAPI/routes/runbooks | XFI-0038; EV-0072; EV-0096 | fixed | docs/api/product | `docs/reference/api-design.md` now states webhook callbacks shipped and explains how they relate to SSE. |
| F-1247 | high | Customer webhook delivery rows are not atomically claimed, so multiple API workers can emit duplicate callbacks for the same attempt | API worker startup; webhook queue store; multi-region / multi-process delivery semantics | XFI-0039; EV-0073 | open | platform/webhooks/ops | The current worker is only correct under a single-worker assumption that conflicts with replicated API deployment and the planned R2/R3 rollout. |
| F-1248 | medium | The documented ten-webhook-per-account limit is enforced with a raceable pre-check, so concurrent creates can exceed the cap | Dashboard webhook quota check; Postgres insert path; schema invariants | XFI-0040; EV-0074 | open | platform/webhooks | The ceiling holds only for serial creates; parallel requests can all pass the handler pre-check before any insert lands. |
| F-1249 | high | Customer webhook callbacks are exposed and operated as a shipped feature, but no production code enqueues any delivery events | Customer webhook event model; queue writer; dashboard/API docs; operational runbooks | XFI-0041; EV-0076 | open | platform/webhooks/product | The worker can drain rows and the API lets customers subscribe, yet no incident/anomaly/divergence producer ever calls `EnqueueDelivery`, so the feature cannot deliver real callbacks. |
| F-1250 | medium | Freeze-event open-row dedupe is raceable, so concurrent same-pair freezes can create multiple still-firing durable rows | Freeze writer; Timescale freeze-event mirror; anomalies timeline/recovery semantics | XFI-0042; EV-0079 | open | aggregate/storage/anomaly | The SQL comment claims transactional dedupe, but the code uses an unlocked `WHERE NOT EXISTS` insert and the PK includes `frozen_at`, so concurrent callers can both insert distinct open rows. |
| F-1251 | high | FX-based `usd_volume` enrichment rejects historical-but-valid rates because freshness is measured against wall-clock time instead of the trade timestamp | Indexer USD-volume Phase 2; VWAP FX resolver; historical/backfill enrichment; integration coverage | XFI-0043; EV-0080 | open | storage/indexer/data-quality | A resolver query at `trade.ts` can find the correct VWAP row and still return `ok=false` solely because the row is older than one hour relative to `time.Now()`, which breaks delayed/backfilled enrichment. |
| F-1252 | medium | Multi-region cutover instructions invoke a nonexistent `make verify-cross-region` launch check | Cutover runbook; verification script; Makefile command surface | XFI-0044; EV-0082 | open | docs/ops/release | The pre-flight checklist names a make target that does not exist, so an operator following the launch runbook gets a Make failure exactly where a gating consistency check is expected. |
| F-1253 | high | Enabling Redis ACL lockdown disables the default user, but the rendered application config never sets `redis_username`, so binaries keep authenticating on the rejected legacy path | Redis Sentinel ACL template; application config template; Redis client builder | XFI-0045; EV-0083 | open | ops/security/config | The hardening flag can break Redis-backed API, aggregator, and indexer behavior at the moment operators flip it because the Ansible-owned app TOML omits the required ACL username. |
| F-1254 | high | Redis ACL lockdown allows stale or wrong key families, so hardened deployments still deny active runtime namespaces after the username handoff is fixed | Redis Sentinel ACL template; Redis namespace builders; API/auth/cache runtime wiring | XFI-0046; EV-0084 | open | ops/security/config | The allow-list uses `ratelimit:*`/`subscriber:*` while code writes `rl:*`/`sub:*`, and it omits several live namespaces entirely: `signup:email:*`, `sep10:seen:*`, `usage:*`, `assets:list:*`, and `markets:list:*`. |
| F-1255 | medium | Concurrent first-login callbacks for the same new email can create orphan accounts and return a 500 because provisioning is not atomic per email | Dashboard magic-link callback; account/user stores; platform schema uniqueness | XFI-0047; EV-0086; EV-0087 | open | platform/auth/data-quality | Token consumption is atomic per token, not per email. Two valid links for one new address can both enter provisioning, persist two account rows, and let the losing user insert fail on `users.email`, leaving a suffixed account without an owner. |
| F-1256 | medium | Dashboard key-rate UI and OpenAPI still promise generic 1000/100000 limits even though the backend now silently clamps by account tier | Dashboard key form; create-key API schema; tier-cap implementation | XFI-0048; EV-0090 | open | dashboard/docs/product | Free users are told the default is 1000/min and every user can submit 100000/min, but current backend persists Free keys at 60/min and other tiers at smaller caps unless the tier allows more. |
| F-1257 | medium | The 25-active-key/account dashboard quota is enforced with a raceable pre-check, so concurrent creates can exceed the advertised cap | Dashboard key quota check; Postgres insert path; platform schema | XFI-0049; EV-0092 | open | platform/keys | The handler counts current active keys before insert, but the store and schema never enforce the ceiling atomically; parallel creates can all pass under the cap together. |
| F-1258 | high | Redis-less API deployments still wire a non-nil usage middleware around a nil Redis client, so authenticated requests can panic instead of degrading cleanly | API startup wiring; usage middleware; usage counter | XFI-0050; EV-0094 | open | api/ops/runtime | The API advertises Redis as optional, but `usage.New(rdb)` is unconditional and the middleware dereferences its nil client once authenticated traffic arrives. |
| F-1259 | medium | `/v1/account/usage` docs and generated references still call the endpoint always-empty even though current runtime wiring can return real Redis-backed daily counts | Account usage handler; OpenAPI/reference docs; product architecture docs | XFI-0051; EV-0095 | open | docs/api/product | Current code wires a usage reader and handler path for real rows, while several authoritative docs/spec outputs still describe a stub-only contract. |

## Finding Template

```md
### F-1201. Title

Severity: `high`

Status: `fixed`

Affected surface:

- `path/to/file.go`

Evidence:

- `EV-0001`
- `XFI-0001`

Expected:

Observed:

Impact:

Reproduction or reasoning path:

Remediation direction:
```

### F-1201. R1 exposes internal storage, observability, and admin services publicly

Severity: `critical`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `configs/ansible/roles/archival-node/tasks/11-firewall.yml`
- `configs/ansible/roles/archival-node/templates/nftables.conf.j2`
- `configs/ansible/roles/archival-node/defaults/main.yml`
- R1 host firewall and listening services

Evidence:

- `XFI-0001`
- `R1-0005`
- `R1-0006`
- `R1-0008`
- `EV-0019`

Expected: R1 should run the repo-managed nftables default-deny policy, UFW should be disabled/stopped, and internal services should be loopback-only or restricted to `internal_cidrs`.

Observed: nftables is disabled/inactive with an empty ruleset; UFW is inactive; external TCP connects succeeded to MinIO, MinIO console, Prometheus, Loki, Promtail, node_exporter, Galexie admin, and captive-core port 11726.

Impact: Public exposure of storage, metrics, logs, admin surfaces, and infrastructure fingerprints creates immediate attack surface and data disclosure risk.

Remediation direction: Apply/verify the nftables role, bind internal daemons to loopback/private interfaces where possible, close public ports at host/provider firewall, and add a pre-launch external port probe that fails on unexpected listeners.

### F-1207. Web apps pin vulnerable Next.js and lack pnpm advisory gates

Severity: `critical`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `web/explorer/package.json`
- `web/dashboard/package.json`
- `web/status/package.json`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/dependabot.yml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0005`
- `EV-0014`
- `EV-0051`

Expected: Public Next.js apps should be on patched versions, with automated pnpm updates and CI advisory gates.

Observed: all three apps pin `next@15.0.4`; `pnpm audit --audit-level moderate` reports 27 advisories per app including 2 critical and 8 high. CI typechecks/lints/builds web apps but does not run `pnpm audit`; Dependabot does not include npm/pnpm ecosystems; hosted GitHub vulnerability and Dependabot alerts are disabled.

Impact: Public explorer/status/dashboard surfaces inherit known RCE/auth-bypass/DoS/cache/XSS classes until upgraded. Dashboard risk is higher because it is account-facing.

Remediation direction: upgrade `next`/`eslint-config-next` across all web apps to a patched compatible release, regenerate lockfiles, add Dependabot npm entries for each web app, enable GitHub vulnerability/Dependabot alerts, and add `pnpm audit --prod --audit-level high` or equivalent to CI.

### F-1211. Status-page incident workflow docs point to removed implementations

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `deploy/status-page/README.md`
- `docs/operations/status-page-setup.md`
- `docs/operations/runbooks/sev-status-page-update.md`
- `deploy/comms/README.md`
- `deploy/comms/incident-update.md`
- `web/status/**`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0007`
- `EV-0021`

Expected: status-page runbooks and customer-comms templates should describe the shipped incident publication workflow for `status.ratesengine.net`.

Observed: the shipped implementation is a custom `web/status` static-export app on Cloudflare Pages, but the operations runbook requires editing removed `deploy/status-page/cstate/**` paths and other docs/templates point to an Upptime `RatesEngine/ratesengine-status` issue flow.

Impact: during a SEV, operators can follow the binding runbook and fail to publish timely customer-visible updates, or publish in a channel not consumed by the live status page.

Remediation direction: choose the canonical incident source for `web/status`, update or delete Upptime/cstate runbooks, add a status-page incident drill to launch readiness, and make docs lint fail on references to removed status-page paths.

### F-1212. Dashboard key creation bypasses account-tier rate limits

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `web/dashboard/src/app/keys/page.tsx`
- `internal/api/v1/dashboardkeys/handlers.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/apikey_store.go`
- `internal/auth/apikey_postgres.go`
- `internal/api/v1/middleware/ratelimit.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0008`
- `EV-0023`
- `EV-0089`

Expected: key rate limits should be derived from account tier/subscription or an operator-approved override, not from a free-form customer dashboard input.

Observed during the initial pass: the dashboard UI submitted `rate_limit_per_min`; the handler accepted any positive value up to 100,000 for owner/admin/member sessions; the Postgres auth validator copied that value into the authenticated subject; the rate-limit middleware used it as the effective per-key budget.

Current-head reconciliation: `dashboardkeys.HandleCreate` now clamps the requested budget through `platform.Tier.MaxRateLimitPerMin` before persistence, and `TestHandleCreate_TierClampsRateLimit` covers the tier ladder. The security bypass itself no longer reproduces on current `HEAD`; the remaining customer-facing copy/spec drift is tracked separately as `F-1256`.

Remediation direction: retained for audit history. The backend clamp and regression tests now close this finding's abuse path; residual dashboard/OpenAPI messaging cleanup lives under `F-1256`.

### F-1213. Stablecoin fiat proxy undercounts Stellar USD volume by 10x in the min-volume manipulation gate

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/aggregate/orchestrator/orchestrator.go`
- `internal/aggregate/stablecoin.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/usd_volume_quote_spec.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/trades.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-aggregator/main.go`
- `configs/example.toml`
- R1 `/etc/ratesengine.toml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0009`
- `EV-0024`
- `R1-0011`

Expected: when `XLM/fiat:USD` expands to on-chain classic/SAC USD-pegged pairs, the min-volume manipulation gate should compute USD volume using the same decimal convention as the quote asset or the stored `trades.usd_volume` value.

Observed: `ExpandTargetPairWithClassicPegs` appends classic USD-pegged assets from `[trades].usd_pegged_classic_assets`; `fetchForTarget` rewrites those trades to `fiat:USD`; then `windowUSDVolume` divides every `QuoteAmount` by `100_000_000`. The storage path separately documents and implements classic/SAC USD pegs as 7-decimal values. R1 has proxy expansion enabled and Circle USDC configured, but sets `min_usd_volume = 0`.

Impact: if the default `aggregate.min_usd_volume = 10000` is enabled with Stellar USD-pegged proxy expansion, a real $10,000 classic-USDC window is treated as $1,000 and dropped. R1 currently avoids the false negative by disabling the threshold entirely, removing a launch-readiness manipulation defense.

Reproduction or reasoning path: a Stellar XLM/USDC trade with `quote_amount=100_000_000_000` represents $10,000 at 7 decimals. `windowUSDVolume` divides that by `1e8` and returns $1,000. The same quote asset is treated as 7-decimal by `USDVolumeQuoteSpec.QuoteUSDPegInfo` and `tradeUSDVolume`.

Remediation direction: make the min-volume gate operate on normalized USD volume, preferably from `trades.usd_volume` or an aggregation query that already carries quote-decimal metadata. If raw trades remain the input, annotate each proxy-expanded trade with the quote scale before rewriting to `fiat:USD`, and add tests covering classic/SAC USDC plus external `crypto:USDC` in the same fiat-USD window.

### F-1214. `main` is unprotected, so required CI, CODEOWNER review, and signed commits are not enforced

Severity: `critical`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- GitHub branch protection / rulesets for `main`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- `CODEOWNERS`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0010`
- `EV-0025`
- `EV-0026`

Expected: `main` should require green CI, CODEOWNER review, signed commits, and no force-push/direct-push path, matching the local contribution policy.

Observed: GitHub reports `main.protected=false`; branch-protection/ruleset API reads fail because the private repo tier does not support the feature. Local docs still say CI, CODEOWNER review, and signed commits are enforced.

Impact: a compromised or mistaken maintainer token can push directly to `main`, alter workflows, cut tags/releases, or deploy code without the review and CI controls the project relies on.

Remediation direction: move the repository to a plan that supports branch protection/rulesets for private repos or make the repo public if that is the intended launch path; enforce required checks, CODEOWNER review, signed commits, linear history, no force pushes, and tag/release protections.

### F-1215. Production deployment environments have no required reviewers despite holding deploy secrets

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- GitHub environments: `r1`, `explorer-production`, `docs-production`, `status-production`, `github-pages`
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/explorer-deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/docs-deploy.yml`
- `.github/workflows/status-page.yml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0010`
- `EV-0025`
- `EV-0026`

Expected: production deploy jobs with SSH or Cloudflare credentials should require environment approval and branch/source restrictions.

Observed: all five environments have empty `protection_rules`; `can_admins_bypass=true`; deploy workflow comments describe reviewers as optional. Repository secrets include the R1 deploy SSH key and Cloudflare token.

Impact: anyone with sufficient workflow-dispatch/write access can trigger production deploy paths without an independent approval gate, raising blast radius for compromised GitHub accounts and accidental releases.

Remediation direction: configure required reviewers, disable admin bypass where possible, restrict deployment branches/tags, split secrets by environment, and add a pre-launch check that fails when production environments lack protection rules.

### F-1216. GitHub Actions allows all third-party actions without SHA pinning while workflows use tag-pinned actions

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- GitHub Actions repository policy
- `.github/workflows/*.yml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0010`
- `EV-0025`
- `EV-0026`

Expected: release/deploy workflows should either use an allow-list of trusted actions or pin external actions to immutable SHAs.

Observed: Actions policy is `allowed_actions=all` and `sha_pinning_required=false`; workflow files call many external actions by mutable version tags, including `cloudflare/wrangler-action@v3`, `stoplightio/spectral-action@v0.8.13`, `grafana/setup-k6-action@v1`, `pnpm/action-setup@v6`, and standard `actions/*` tags.

Impact: a compromised upstream action tag or newly introduced unreviewed action can execute in CI with repository or deployment secrets, including release/deploy paths.

Remediation direction: set Actions policy to selected trusted actions, enable SHA pinning or pin non-GitHub-owned actions to full commit SHAs, review transitive deployment actions, and add workflow linting for unpinned `uses:` entries.

### F-1217. SEP-10 replay protection is optional and can run guard-free when Redis is absent

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/auth/sep10/validator.go`
- `internal/api/v1/auth_sep10.go`
- `internal/auth/sep10/validator_test.go`
- R1 SEP-10 runtime configuration

Evidence:

- `XFI-0011`
- `EV-0027`
- `EV-0053`
- `R1-0012`

Expected: when SEP-10 authentication is enabled, replay protection should be mandatory and fail closed; a signed challenge should be accepted once for its time-bound window.

Observed: current source implements a Redis-backed `ReplayGuard` and wires it when Redis is configured. The same startup path still permits a configured SEP-10 validator without Redis and explicitly leaves it guard-free when Redis is absent; `auth_mode=sep10` does not require a guard. R1 currently returns 503 for SEP-10, so this is a latent source/configuration flaw until SEP-10 is enabled.

Impact: an operator can enable SEP-10 in a Redis-less or mis-scoped deployment and unknowingly preserve replayable signed challenges. If a signed challenge XDR is captured, it can be reused within the challenge window on that guardless deployment to mint additional valid JWTs.

Remediation direction: require a replay guard whenever `auth_mode=sep10` or public SEP-10 token issuance is enabled. Treat missing Redis/guard as a startup error or add a Postgres-backed guard fallback; add startup tests for `auth_mode=sep10` with no Redis and token-flow tests proving guardless operation is rejected.

### F-1218. Public signup can mint immediately usable 1000/min API keys from unverified emails and non-atomic duplicate checks

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/signup.go`
- `internal/api/v1/signup_test.go`
- `internal/auth/signup_tracker.go`
- `internal/auth/store.go`
- `web/explorer/src/app/signup/page.tsx`
- `openapi/rates-engine.v1.yaml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0012`
- `EV-0028`

Expected: self-service key minting should prove email ownership or use a stronger anti-abuse gate before issuing a usable 1000/min key; duplicate checks should be atomic if they are the idempotency guarantee.

Observed: `/v1/signup` mints a plaintext Starter API key immediately from a parsed email string. The duplicate tracker is optional and tests pin that duplicate signup succeeds when it is nil. When Redis is wired, the flow still performs lookup, key create, then SETNX mark, so concurrent same-email requests can mint multiple keys.

Impact: attackers can cheaply mint large numbers of free API keys with rotating email strings or races, bypassing the anonymous 60/min floor and creating capacity/billing abuse.

Remediation direction: route signup through the magic-link/dashboard account flow or require email verification before exposing plaintext keys; make idempotency atomic by reserving the email hash before key creation; add per-email/domain/device abuse controls and alerting.

### F-1219. Stripe paid-upgrade webhook still bypasses platform subscription and dashboard-key sources of truth

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/stripe_webhook.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-api/main.go`
- `internal/platform/billing.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/`
- `migrations/0027_platform_v1_schema.up.sql`
- dashboard/API key billing flows

Evidence:

- `XFI-0013`
- `EV-0030`
- `EV-0053`

Expected: Stripe paid-upgrade events should update the same account, subscription, and API-key records that dashboard users and runtime auth consume, with durable idempotency and audit.

Observed: current source wires Postgres event dedupe and audit rows when Postgres is available, which reduces the earlier idempotency gap. The side effect still uses `auth.RedisAPIKeyStore`: it finds keys by `client_reference_id` and updates Redis key rate limits only. The webhook does not call `UpsertSubscription`, does not update Postgres dashboard keys/accounts/subscription state, acknowledges paid events with no keys as 200, and can return 200 after partial or total key-update failure.

Impact: paid customers using dashboard-created keys can pay and still keep old limits or missing subscription state; customer-facing dashboard/billing truth can disagree with legacy Redis key state; failed upgrades can be acknowledged and then require manual reconciliation.

Remediation direction: move Stripe side effects onto platform Postgres account/subscription/API-key stores, call subscription upserts for relevant Stripe event types, update all active account keys in the runtime source of truth, and return retryable status on unambiguous total failure.

### F-1220. Tagged deploys can restart schema-dependent binaries without shipping or applying matching migrations

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- `configs/ansible/playbooks/deploy-binary.yml`
- `configs/ansible/tasks/deploy-one-binary.yml`
- `configs/ansible/roles/archival-node/tasks/14-ratesengine-services.yml`
- `migrations/*`
- `docs/operations/runbooks/fx-history-missing.md`
- R1 `schema_migrations`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0014`
- `EV-0031`
- `R1-0013`

Expected: a tagged production deploy that can introduce code depending on new tables, columns, CAGGs, or indexes should ship and apply the matching migration set before restarting binaries, or fail readiness when the binary and database schema diverge.

Observed: the current deploy workflow downloads release binaries, verifies checksums, and runs an Ansible binary-swap playbook. That playbook restarts/probes services but does not copy `migrations/`, run `ratesengine-migrate up`, or check `schema_migrations`. Migration sync/apply exists in the initial archival-node role and manual runbook instructions instead. R1 currently reports schema `28|f`, but the deploy mechanism itself would not prevent a future binary/schema mismatch.

Impact: a release can pass checksum and `/v1/healthz` probes while code paths depending on a new migration fail at runtime, creating partial outages or silent feature breakage after deploy.

Remediation direction: make migrations a first-class deploy artifact and pre-binary step, or embed an expected schema version in each binary and gate `/readyz`/deploy on matching `schema_migrations`. Add an integration test or CI check proving migrations are included in the release/deploy contract.

### F-1221. Release/deploy docs still claim GHCR container image publishing that the current release workflow explicitly removed

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `docs/operations/deploy-workflow.md`
- `docs/operations/release-process.md`
- Docker/self-hosting expectations

Evidence:

- `XFI-0014`
- `EV-0032`

Expected: release documentation should describe the artifacts the current workflow actually publishes.

Observed: the release workflow explicitly says container images are not built or pushed, but both deploy and release process docs still state that release tags build and push GHCR images.

Impact: operators and self-hosters can wait on or automate against nonexistent container artifacts, delaying recovery or deploys and increasing the chance of manual image builds from the wrong commit.

Remediation direction: update release/deploy docs and any release templates to state binary-only publication, or restore the GHCR job and permissions if container artifacts are now required.

### F-1222. Rollback docs point operators to nonexistent `/opt/ratesengine/release-<tag>` directories instead of actual binary backups

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `docs/operations/release-process.md`
- `docs/operations/deploy-workflow.md`
- `configs/ansible/tasks/deploy-one-binary.yml`
- R1 deployed-version sidecars

Evidence:

- `XFI-0014`
- `EV-0032`
- `R1-0013`

Expected: emergency rollback docs should match the artifacts created by the deploy workflow and present on the host.

Observed: the release process fallback tells operators to copy binaries from `/opt/ratesengine/release-<tag>/`, but the deploy task stores previous binaries as `/usr/local/bin/<binary>.prev-<tag>` and version markers under `/var/lib/ratesengine/deployed-versions`.

Impact: during a production rollback, the documented fallback path can fail at the first file lookup, wasting incident time and encouraging ad hoc rebuilds or untracked manual swaps.

Remediation direction: update rollback docs to use the workflow as primary and the actual `.prev-<tag>` backup layout as fallback, including sidecar updates and post-rollback health checks.

### F-1223. R1 runs a stale Caddyfile that exposes `/metrics` publicly and collapses Cloudflare client IPs to edge IPs

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `configs/caddy/Caddyfile.api`
- R1 `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`
- R1 `/etc/ratesengine.toml`
- `internal/api/v1/middleware/remoteip.go`
- public `https://api.ratesengine.net/metrics`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0015`
- `EV-0033`
- `R1-0014`

Expected: R1 should run the reviewed Caddyfile that resolves real client IPs from Cloudflare trusted ranges and blocks `/metrics` on the public API hostname.

Observed: the live Caddyfile lacks the repo's Cloudflare `trusted_proxies`/`client_ip_headers` block, forwards `{remote_host}` as `X-Forwarded-For`, and does not block `/metrics`. External `/metrics` returned HTTP 200 with Go runtime, route-level, cache, stream, and Rates Engine metric names and values.

Impact: anonymous clients can scrape internal operational metrics and route counters; behind Cloudflare, per-IP logging/rate limiting sees Cloudflare edge IPs rather than customers, so unrelated users on the same edge can collide in anonymous buckets.

Remediation direction: deploy the current source Caddyfile or equivalent immediately; verify `/metrics` returns 404 externally, `{client_ip}` reaches the API from Cloudflare, and direct-origin requests cannot spoof client identity.

### F-1224. Dashboard magic-link and session audit IP fields record proxy/loopback IPs instead of real client IPs

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/dashboardauth/handlers.go`
- `internal/api/v1/dashboardauth/middleware.go`
- `internal/api/v1/middleware/remoteip.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/token_store.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/user_store.go`
- `migrations/0027_platform_v1_schema.up.sql`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0016`
- `EV-0034`
- `R1-0014`

Expected: dashboard login, magic-link, and session security records should use the same trusted-proxy-resolved client IP as logging, anonymous identity, and rate limiting.

Observed: dashboard auth defines its own `clientIP(r)` helper that parses `r.RemoteAddr`. The middleware-resolved IP is stored in context, not `RemoteAddr`; behind Caddy the socket peer is the local proxy. Those values are written to `magic_link_tokens.requested_ip`, `users.ip_first_seen`, `users.ip_last_seen`, and session touch updates.

Impact: new-login/new-country security signals and account audit data are inaccurate in production, reducing the value of abuse investigations and customer-facing security history.

Remediation direction: replace dashboard auth's local helper with `middleware.RemoteIPFrom(r)` or pass the resolved IP through a small shared helper; add tests where `RemoteAddr=127.0.0.1` and trusted XFF carries the client IP.

### F-1225. `/v1/history/since-inception` returns empty XLM/USD history while chart and direct USDC history have data

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/history.go`
- `internal/api/v1/chart.go`
- `internal/api/v1/vwap.go`
- `internal/api/v1/ohlc.go`
- `internal/api/v1/price.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/aggregates.go`
- R1 historical price API

Evidence:

- `XFI-0017`
- `EV-0035`
- `R1-0015`

Expected: historical USD price surfaces should agree on the declared Stellar USD proxy policy, or return an explicit unsupported/fallback-missing signal.

Observed: `handleHistorySinceInception` queries the literal CAGG pair and returns it directly. It does not apply the stablecoin fallback that chart, price, VWAP, TWAP, and OHLC paths use for `X/fiat:USD`. On R1, `native/fiat:USD` since-inception returned no points while the chart endpoint returned XLM/USD daily points and direct `native/USDC-GA5Z...` history returned populated points.

Impact: clients building long-range price charts from the documented since-inception API see no XLM/USD history even though the system has the data under the configured Stellar USDC market. This is a visible product parity failure against CoinGecko/CMC-style historical chart APIs.

Remediation direction: share the chart stablecoin fallback with since-inception history, preserve `flags.triangulated=true` when it fires, and add tests comparing direct peg history with `fiat:USD` history for the same asset/granularity.

### F-1226. Dashboard API-key allowlists, permissions, monthly quotas, and usage fields are accepted but not enforced at runtime

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `migrations/0027_platform_v1_schema.up.sql`
- `internal/platform/apikey.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/apikey_store.go`
- `internal/api/v1/dashboardkeys/handlers.go`
- `internal/auth/apikey_postgres.go`
- `internal/api/v1/middleware/auth.go`
- `internal/api/v1/middleware/ratelimit.go`
- dashboard/OpenAPI key-management surfaces

Evidence:

- `XFI-0018`
- `EV-0036`

Expected: customer-visible key policy fields should be enforced on every authenticated request, or the UI/API should clearly mark them as not active.

Observed: dashboard key creation stores `monthly_quota`, `permissions`, `ip_allowlist`, `referer_allowlist`, and expiry/revocation fields. Runtime auth validates only key hash, revocation, expiry, and account status, then returns a subject containing tier/key/rate-limit. There is no request-aware check for client IP, referer, permissions, monthly quota, or usage increments; `TouchUsage` has no production caller.

Impact: customers can create keys that appear IP-bound, referer-bound, scoped, or quota-limited, but those controls do not protect the API. This is a security and trust issue for dashboard users and a billing-control gap for paid plans.

Remediation direction: add a request-aware key policy middleware after auth that enforces IP/referer/permission/monthly quota, updates debounced usage, and returns 403/429 with clear problem bodies. Hide or label fields as pending until enforcement is live.

### F-1227. The `ratesengine-migrate` container cannot apply bundled migrations out of the box

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `docker/ratesengine-migrate.Dockerfile`
- `cmd/ratesengine-migrate/main.go`
- `migrations/*`
- `Makefile`
- `docker/README.md`
- `configs/ansible/roles/archival-node/tasks/14-ratesengine-services.yml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0019`
- `EV-0037`

Expected: a self-hosted operator should be able to run the migration container with the same migration corpus the binary expects, or the Docker docs and smoke tests should make the required external mount/path explicit.

Observed: the binary defaults to `-migrations migrations`, but the distroless runtime image copies only `/usr/local/bin/ratesengine-migrate`. No `migrations/*.sql` files are present at the default path. `make smoke-docker` only invokes `--help`, so it does not verify that `status` or `up` can open the source directory. The bare-metal Ansible role separately syncs migrations and invokes `-migrations /usr/local/share/ratesengine/migrations`; the Docker path lacks that equivalent contract.

Impact: self-hosted Docker/Compose/Kubernetes operators can build a valid-looking migration image that fails at schema bootstrap time, delaying installation or upgrades and making the container packaging less reliable than the documented bare-metal path.

Remediation direction: either copy migrations into the migrate image at a stable path and set the documented default accordingly, or require a bind mount in the Docker docs and smoke-test that the image can open the configured migration source.

### F-1238. Redis-less API deployments fail startup because closed-bucket stream subscriber is gated on Hub, not Redis

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `cmd/ratesengine-api/main.go`
- `internal/api/streaming/redispub/subscriber.go`
- `docs/reference/config/README.md`
- `configs/example.toml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0030`
- `EV-0054`

Expected: Redis-dependent API features should degrade independently when Redis is absent, matching the startup comments and readiness semantics. A Redis-less API should still boot if the operator intentionally omits Redis, with closed-bucket streaming disabled/degraded rather than fatal.

Observed: `cmd/ratesengine-api` creates `hub := streaming.NewHub(0)` unconditionally. Later, it checks `if hub != nil` and calls `redispub.NewSubscriber(rdb, ...)`; `hub` is always non-nil, so a nil Redis client returns `redispub: RedisSubscriber is required` and aborts startup. Other Redis-backed features are correctly gated on `rdb != nil`.

Impact: an operator following the documented "Redis optional at API layer" posture cannot run a Redis-less API. A local, staging, or degraded production deployment that should serve read-only Timescale-backed endpoints instead fails before listening.

Remediation direction: gate the Redis pub/sub subscriber on `rdb != nil`, and make the stream endpoint's no-Redis behavior explicit: either no Hub so it returns 503, or Hub-only heartbeats with a degraded metric. Add a startup unit test for `run`/wiring with nil Redis or a small constructor-level test proving subscriber creation is skipped.

### F-1228. SSE streams are cut off after 30 seconds by the API server write timeout

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `cmd/ratesengine-api/main.go`
- `internal/api/streaming/handler.go`
- `internal/api/v1/price_stream.go`
- `internal/api/v1/price_tip_stream.go`
- `internal/api/v1/observations_stream.go`
- `docs/operations/customer-demo-script.md`
- R1 live API

Evidence:

- `XFI-0020`
- `EV-0038`
- `R1-0016`

Expected: `/v1/price/stream`, `/v1/price/tip/stream`, and `/v1/observations/stream` should support long-lived SSE clients, with heartbeats preventing idle proxy closure and reconnect/resume handling real network breaks.

Observed: the API `http.Server` sets `WriteTimeout: 30 * time.Second`. Go applies that as a response-write timeout reset when a new request's headers are read, not as a heartbeat-aware per-frame deadline. R1 loopback testing confirmed `/v1/price/tip/stream` emits events through 25 seconds and then closes at elapsed 30 seconds.

Impact: real-time streaming is not actually long-lived. Browser/EventSource and curl clients reconnect every 30 seconds, increasing churn and load; customer demos that instruct a 60-second run fail; CoinGecko/CMC parity for streaming or trade-tape style experiences is weaker than the API contract suggests.

Remediation direction: remove the global write timeout for the API server or route streaming endpoints through a server/listener with no absolute `WriteTimeout`; if write deadlines are required, manage them per write with `http.ResponseController` and tests that keep a stream open beyond the timeout horizon.

### F-1229. CDN verification script probes invalid price/SSE URLs and asserts the wrong SSE cache header

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `scripts/dev/verify-cdn.sh`
- `internal/api/v1/price_tip.go`
- `internal/api/v1/price_tip_stream.go`
- `internal/api/streaming/handler.go`
- `openapi/rates-engine.v1.yaml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0021`
- `EV-0039`

Expected: CDN verification should prove the real hot, auth, historical, and streaming routes behave correctly at the edge.

Observed: the script checks `/v1/price?base=native&quote=fiat:USD` and `/v1/price/tip/stream?base=native&quote=fiat:USD`, but those endpoints require `asset`, not `base`. R1 returns 400 `missing-asset` for the SSE URL. The script also expects `Cache-Control` to include `no-store` for SSE while the streaming handler sets `no-cache`.

Impact: operators can get misleading CDN validation results during launch or edge changes. A failure may be caused by the script's invalid URL rather than CDN buffering, and a corrected URL would still fail the script's stale cache-header expectation.

Remediation direction: update the script to use `asset=native`, assert the stream endpoint's intended `Cache-Control`, and include a short body read that proves the response is actually `text/event-stream`.

### F-1230. R1 `since-inception` history for core XLM/USDC starts on 2026-05-03, not one year or inception

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/history.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/aggregates.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-ops/backfill.go`
- `docs/freighter-rfp.md`
- `docs/architecture/coverage-matrix.md`
- R1 historical API/data

Evidence:

- `XFI-0022`
- `EV-0040`
- `R1-0017`

Expected: launch history for core Stellar pairs should meet the Freighter minimum of one year, ideally since inception, or clearly mark the deployment's historical coverage as incomplete.

Observed: R1 direct XLM/Circle-USDC `/v1/history/since-inception?granularity=1d` returned only nine daily points, starting `2026-05-03T00:00:00Z` and ending `2026-05-11T00:00:00Z`. The handler returns available closed buckets without a completeness marker or backfill coverage range.

Impact: customers using the “since inception” endpoint for long-range charts get a recent ingest window while the API name implies full history. This is a direct product-parity gap against CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap and does not satisfy the Freighter minimum historical-retention requirement.

Remediation direction: run and verify historical backfill for launch-critical pairs, expose per-pair `earliest_available_at`/backfill completeness metadata, and avoid marketing or docs language that implies inception coverage before the data exists.

### F-1231. Canonical CI is PR-only while `main` is unprotected, so direct pushes can bypass full verification

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/api-audit.yml`
- `CONTRIBUTING.md`
- hosted GitHub branch protection

Evidence:

- `XFI-0023`
- `EV-0041`
- `EV-0025`

Expected: every change reaching `main` should either have passed the canonical CI workflow through an enforced PR path, or the same canonical gate should run on main pushes.

Observed: `ci.yml` triggers only on `pull_request` and explicitly disables push-to-main CI. Hosted GitHub reports `main.protected=false`, so the PR-only assumption is not enforced. The path-limited `api-audit` workflow can run on some main pushes, but it only smokes public API examples and is not equivalent to lint, tests, builds, import rules, govulncheck, gitleaks, OpenAPI generation, and web app checks.

Impact: a direct push to `main` can land broken code or vulnerable dependencies without the full suite running. This compounds the existing branch-protection finding and weakens release confidence for a project preparing public market-data launch.

Remediation direction: either enable enforceable branch protection that requires the `ci` jobs before merge, or restore the canonical `ci` push trigger for `main` until protection is actually active.

### F-1232. Circle USDC has `price_usd` on asset detail but 404s or disappears from `/v1/price` and batch price APIs

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/price.go`
- `internal/api/v1/assets.go`
- `internal/api/v1/assets_f2.go`
- `internal/api/v1/assets_coin_extension.go`
- `openapi/rates-engine.v1.yaml`
- R1 price and asset APIs

Evidence:

- `XFI-0024`
- `EV-0042`
- `R1-0018`

Expected: a core stablecoin with a USD price on `/v1/assets/{id}` should return the same effective USD price through `/v1/price` and `/v1/price/batch`, especially for CoinGecko/CMC-style stablecoin listings.

Observed: R1 `/v1/assets/USDC-GA5Z...` returns `price_usd:"0.9999838427"`. The same asset passed to `/v1/price?asset=USDC-GA5Z...&quote=fiat:USD` returns 404, and both GET and POST `/v1/price/batch` return an empty array. The price fallback skips declared USD pegs when the requested asset is the peg itself, while the asset detail path can still populate `price_usd` from its coin-overlay/enrichment path.

Impact: clients cannot rely on the price APIs for one of the most important Stellar assets, and batch consumers silently drop USDC even though asset detail displays a price. This is a visible parity gap for wallet and market-listing integrations.

Remediation direction: define first-class stablecoin-to-fiat behavior for declared pegs, return an explicit approximately-one USD price or the enrichment price consistently across single and batch price endpoints, and add tests that compare asset detail, single price, and batch rows for Circle USDC.

### F-1233. SDEX historical backfill silently drops legacy V0 claim atoms while claiming genesis coverage

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/sources/sdex/decode.go`
- `internal/sources/sdex/dispatcher_adapter.go`
- `internal/dispatcher/dispatcher.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-ops/backfill.go`
- `internal/sources/sdex/README.md`
- `docs/discovery/dexes-amms/sdex.md`
- `docs/discovery/protocol-versions.md`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0025`
- `EV-0044`

Expected: SDEX backfill either decodes every claim-atom shape required by the requested historical range, including legacy V0, or rejects/marks unsupported ranges with visible errors and coverage metadata.

Observed: `decodeClaimAtom` returns `ErrUnknownClaimAtomType` for `ClaimAtomTypeV0`, the legacy raw-Ed25519 claim atom shape. The SDEX dispatcher adapter catches each per-claim error and continues, returning a successful `Decode` result with fewer outputs. Because the dispatcher only increments `DecodeErrors` when `OpDecoder.Decode` itself returns an error, replaying old ledgers drops V0 fills without an error metric. The same package README says SDEX backfill is supported to genesis, while the discovery notes say historical backfill must handle V0.

Impact: since-inception and one-year-plus SDEX history is materially incomplete for old protocol ranges, but operators and clients get no direct signal that data was skipped. This weakens market-history depth claims and any CoinGecko/CMC-style charting, volume, or OHLC computation over pre-modern Stellar DEX history.

Remediation direction: implement V0 decoding by deriving the seller G-address from raw Ed25519 bytes, add fixture/unit coverage for V0 claim atoms, and add backfill-range coverage metadata or explicit unsupported-range rejection for any protocol-era gaps.

### F-1234. Oracle decoders silently skip unknown feeds inside mixed batches, hiding upstream coverage drift

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/sources/reflector/decode.go`
- `internal/sources/redstone/decode.go`
- `internal/sources/band/decode.go`
- `internal/canonical/asset_*.go`
- `internal/dispatcher/dispatcher.go`
- `internal/dispatcher/statsflush/flusher.go`
- `docs/operations/runbooks/decode-errors.md`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0026`
- `EV-0045`

Expected: when a configured oracle contract publishes an asset/feed that the product cannot yet canonicalize, operators should get an explicit coverage-drift signal, even if the same on-chain event also contains known assets.

Observed: Reflector, Redstone, and Band all skip unknown symbols/feed IDs inside mixed batches and return success when at least one known entry remains. The dispatcher only increments decode-error counters when the decoder returns an error, so partial unknown-feed skips are invisible to `SourceDecodeErrorsTotal` and decoder stats. Tests intentionally pin this behavior for mixed known/unknown batches.

Impact: upstream oracle coverage can expand while Rates Engine silently omits the new asset from oracle rows, explorer coverage, cross-oracle confidence, and parity claims. This matters for competing with broad market-data products because the gap is not discoverable from normal decode-error runbooks.

Remediation direction: add per-source unknown-symbol/feed counters and decoder-stats rows, persist skipped feed IDs for operator review, or run an explicit feed-list reconciliation job against configured oracle contracts. Keep partial success if desired, but make the omitted entries observable.

### F-1235. External CEX stream parser errors are skipped without the decode-error metrics promised by runbooks

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/sources/external/binance/streamer.go`
- `internal/sources/external/kraken/streamer.go`
- `internal/sources/external/bitstamp/streamer.go`
- `internal/sources/external/coinbase/streamer.go`
- `internal/sources/external/runner.go`
- `internal/obs/metrics.go`
- `internal/sources/external/README.md`
- `docs/operations/runbooks/decode-errors.md`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0027`
- `EV-0046`

Expected: malformed external websocket frames, unknown subscribed symbols, and vendor schema drift should increment a per-source metric that the decode-error runbook and monitoring can alert on.

Observed: all four CEX streamers skip parser errors and continue the stream without incrementing `SourceDecodeErrorsTotal` or another parser-error counter. The runner only records poller outcomes, not websocket parse failures. The external connector README says these connectors contribute to the same decode-error budget as on-chain decoders.

Impact: a vendor-side schema change or unexpected feed payload can silently reduce live trade coverage. Operators may only notice after price freshness or source-stopped alerts fire, and the decode-errors runbook will show no evidence even though the parse path is failing.

Remediation direction: increment a source-labelled parse/decode counter on every skipped streamer parse error, include reason labels with bounded cardinality, and update tests/runbooks so injected malformed frames produce observable metrics without killing the stream.

### F-1236. Supply snapshots can be stamped at a fresh ledger while using stale component observations

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `cmd/ratesengine-aggregator/main.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-ops/supply.go`
- `internal/supply/refresher.go`
- `internal/supply/storage_classic_reader.go`
- `internal/supply/storage_sep41_reader.go`
- `internal/supply/lcm_reader.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/classic_supply_observations.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/account_observations.go`
- asset detail / market-cap consumers of `asset_supply_history`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0028`
- `EV-0047`

Expected: a supply snapshot for ledger `N` should be computed from supply-observer components that are complete through ledger `N`, or it should publish explicit component freshness/lag metadata and avoid presenting stale inputs as current supply.

Observed: the aggregator and CLI choose the maximum `last_ledger` across ingestion cursors as the snapshot ledger. Component readers then use `AtOrBefore` storage queries for trustlines, claimable balances, LP reserves, SAC balances, SEP-41 event totals, and account observations. These reader interfaces return balances/totals but not the ledger of each component row, so the refresher cannot detect a stale component before inserting a snapshot at the max ledger.

Impact: if one supply observer stalls while another source advances, asset supply and derived market-cap fields can look current but include old balances. This is especially risky for Stellar-specific depth claims around classic/SAC/SEP-41 supply and for customer-facing asset detail pages.

Remediation direction: resolve the snapshot ledger as the minimum complete ledger across all required supply observer cursors for the target asset, or return component ledgers from storage readers and reject/mark snapshots when any component exceeds a freshness lag. Expose component freshness in diagnostics and tests.

### F-1237. CoinMarketCap polling ignores verified CMC IDs and can bind ambiguous tickers to the wrong asset

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/currency/data/seed.yaml`
- `internal/currency/verified.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-indexer/main.go`
- `internal/sources/external/coinmarketcap/poller.go`
- `internal/sources/external/coinmarketcap/poller_test.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0029`
- `EV-0048`

Expected: CoinMarketCap observations should resolve to the verified currency identity, using the numeric CMC IDs already stored in the catalogue when available.

Observed: the indexer builds a ticker-only `aggregatorPairs` list, and the CMC poller queries `symbol=` rather than the catalogue's numeric `coinmarketcap_id`. When CMC returns multiple coins for a ticker, the poller takes `coins[0]`; a test explicitly pins that behavior.

Impact: CMC can write an oracle update for the wrong project when tickers collide or ranking changes. That corrupts external divergence checks and customer-facing parity against CMC for any ambiguous ticker.

Remediation direction: thread `Catalogue.CoinMarketCapIDs()` into the CMC poller and query/filter by CMC ID when available. Keep symbol fallback only for entries without an ID, and add tests where the correct verified ID is not the first duplicate ticker.

### F-1239. WASM history and extraction ops tools panic at completion when progress output is disabled

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `cmd/ratesengine-ops/main.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-ops/wasm_extract.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-ops/wasm_history_test.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-ops/wasm_extract_test.go`
- `docs/operations/wasm-audits/**`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0031`
- `EV-0055`

Expected: long-running WASM history and WASM extraction audit commands should either reject `-progress-every 0` or treat it consistently as "disable progress output" without affecting final artifact production.

Observed: both command paths guard in-loop progress printing with `progressEvery > 0`, but after the stream finishes they add the uncounted residue with `workerScanned % progressEvery`. Supplying `-progress-every 0` therefore panics after the expensive ledger walk.

Impact: an operator can lose a long-running WASM audit/extraction run at completion and may be left with incomplete or missing final JSON/WASM artifacts. That directly weakens the evidence trail used for Stellar-specific Soroban market coverage.

Remediation direction: validate `-progress-every` as `> 0` or make zero a supported disable mode by adding the full `workerScanned` residue without modulo. Add tests for zero and nonzero progress intervals in both `wasm-history` and `extract-wasm-from-galexie`.

### F-1240. Docker images build with a different Go toolchain than CI/release while docs claim binary equivalence

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `docker/ratesengine-api.Dockerfile`
- `docker/ratesengine-indexer.Dockerfile`
- `docker/ratesengine-aggregator.Dockerfile`
- `docker/ratesengine-ops.Dockerfile`
- `docker/ratesengine-migrate.Dockerfile`
- `docker/ratesengine-sla-probe.Dockerfile`
- `docker/README.md`
- `go.mod`
- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release.yml`
- `.github/workflows/release-validate.yml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0032`
- `EV-0057`

Expected: container builds should use the same reviewed Go toolchain as CI and release binaries, or the repository should explicitly document and test a deliberate toolchain skew.

Observed: CI and release builds resolve Go from `go.mod`, currently `go 1.25.10`. The Docker README says the builder stage uses `golang:1.25-alpine` and produces binaries equivalent to release builds. Every Dockerfile instead uses `golang:1.26-alpine`.

Impact: self-hosted Docker images can be built with a newer compiler/runtime than the release artifacts and tested CI matrix. That weakens reproducibility and can create build, performance, or behavior differences that the release workflow did not exercise.

Remediation direction: align all Dockerfiles with the module/release Go version, preferably from a single generated or linted source of truth. Add a CI check that Dockerfile `FROM golang:` tags match `go.mod`, or update docs/tests if a newer image toolchain is intentionally supported.

### F-1241. The operator migration index stops at `0015` even though the repository ships dense schema history through `0029`

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `migrations/README.md`
- `migrations/0016_*.sql` through `migrations/0029_*.sql`
- deployment, incident, and schema-review workflows that use the README as the human-readable migration map

Evidence:

- `XFI-0033`
- `EV-0058`
- `EV-0059`

Expected: the migration README's "Current migrations" table should enumerate every shipped numbered migration family and stay synchronized with the dense on-disk migration sequence it claims to describe.

Observed: the migration tree is dense and paired through `0029`, and the integration round-trip test passes against that full set. The README's current-migration table still ends at `0015` while explicitly telling maintainers to update it whenever a new migration lands.

Impact: operators and reviewers using the README to reason about deploy prerequisites, schema drift, or incident response can miss fourteen later schema families, including platform billing/auth tables, FX history storage, contribution/router tables, classic asset registry, and recent schema maintenance. That increases the chance of incorrect deploy assumptions or incomplete troubleshooting.

Remediation direction: update the README table through the latest migration, add a lightweight drift check that compares listed migration numbers to on-disk `.up.sql` families, and keep future schema-index changes coupled to migration review.

### F-1242. The live contribution-history sink persists rows with `volume_usd=NULL` even though the schema reserves that field for source-transparency UX

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `cmd/ratesengine-aggregator/main.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-aggregator/contribution_sink.go`
- `internal/aggregate/vwap.go`
- `internal/aggregate/orchestrator/orchestrator.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/price_source_contributions.go`
- `migrations/0026_create_source_contributions_and_sdex_offers.up.sql`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0034`
- `EV-0060`

Expected: if the aggregator durably records per-source contribution history before the source-breakdown product surface ships, the persisted row should contain the fields that schema/comments say will power that surface, or the unused fields should stay explicitly unclaimed and unwritten.

Observed: the production aggregator wires `ContributionSink` on every orchestrator run. The storage row includes `VolumeUSD`, and migration 0026 says `volume_usd` powers the per-source dollar tooltip, but the sink forwards only asset, quote, bucket, source, weight, and trade count. `VolumeUSD` is never populated by any production caller, so the database stores `NULL` for every contribution row.

Impact: the system is already accumulating contribution-history rows that cannot support source-level USD-attribution UX or analytics later without recomputing historical state from the raw trade table. That weakens the planned CoinGecko/CoinMarketCap-parity transparency surface and makes future rollout depend on a backfill the current design does not mention.

Remediation direction: decide whether `volume_usd` is part of the shipped contribution-history contract. If yes, carry per-source USD volume into `SourceContribution`/`ContributionRecord` and persist it with tests; if no, remove or clearly defer the column/commentary until the feature has a real writer. Add a migration/storage integration test proving the chosen contract.

### F-1243. Classic-asset registry freshness and observation counts freeze after the first same-process trade for an asset

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/storage/timescale/trades.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/asset_registry.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/coins.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/issuers.go`
- `internal/api/v1/assets.go`
- `internal/api/v1/issuers.go`
- `test/integration/issuers_coins_storage_test.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0035`
- `EV-0062`

Expected: repeated observed trades for a classic asset should keep `classic_assets.first_seen_*`, `last_seen_*`, and `observation_count` accurate within a single long-running live-ingest or backfill process. Replay order should not matter.

Observed: `InsertTrade` invokes `registerClassicAssetSeen` after each successful stored trade, but `assetRegistryDedupe` returns early once an asset has been touched once in the current process. That happens before the SQL upsert which would apply `LEAST` to first-seen, `GREATEST` to last-seen, and increment `observation_count`. The conflict-update logic therefore does not run for later same-process observations. Existing integration coverage seeds `classic_assets` directly instead of exercising this writer path.

Impact: asset and issuer catalogue metadata can undercount observations by orders of magnitude, preserve the wrong first-seen ledger during out-of-order replay, and freeze last-seen freshness until the indexer restarts. Those fields drive ranking, trust signals, and customer-facing asset/issuer detail views, so this is a live data-quality issue rather than a cosmetic counter drift.

Remediation direction: remove or narrow the process-lifetime dedupe so correctness updates still occur, or replace it with a bounded coalescing/batching strategy that preserves first/last/count semantics. Add integration coverage that inserts multiple trades for the same classic asset in one process, including out-of-order ledger replay, then asserts `first_seen_*`, `last_seen_*`, and `observation_count`.

### F-1244. Dashboard webhook signing secrets are persisted as live HMAC keys while docs and type names claim hash-only / never-persisted semantics

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/dashboardwebhooks/handlers.go`
- `internal/platform/webhook.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/webhook_store.go`
- `internal/customerwebhook/worker.go`
- `migrations/0027_platform_v1_schema.up.sql`
- `openapi/rates-engine.v1.yaml`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0036`
- `EV-0068`

Expected: the webhook secret-handling contract should be explicit and true. If only hashes are persisted, the runtime must not need the plaintext-equivalent signing key later. If outbound signing requires retrievable key material, the schema/API/docs should say so and the stored key should receive an appropriate at-rest protection model.

Observed: the create handler generates a plaintext `wsec_*` secret, passes `SecretHash: []byte(secret)`, and the Postgres store inserts those bytes directly into `customer_webhooks.secret_hash`. The delivery worker later uses that field as the actual HMAC key. Simultaneously, the platform type comments, rotate stub, handler comments, and OpenAPI text say the field is a hash or that plaintext is returned once and never persisted.

Impact: operators, reviewers, and customers are given a false security model. A database compromise or over-broad read path exposes signing keys that let an attacker forge outbound webhook signatures for customers, while the code/docs currently imply those secrets are not recoverable from storage.

Remediation direction: choose one honest design. Either store an encrypted/recoverable signing key under a correctly named field with documented at-rest protections and rotation, or change the delivery protocol so the persisted value can truly be non-reversible. Update schema naming/docs/tests in lockstep.

### F-1245. Customer webhook URLs create an outbound SSRF primitive because validation enforces only `https://` and the worker follows default redirects

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/dashboardwebhooks/handlers.go`
- `internal/customerwebhook/worker.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-api/main.go`
- `internal/api/v1/dashboardwebhooks/handlers_test.go`
- `internal/customerwebhook/worker_test.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0037`
- `EV-0069`

Expected: user-configured outbound webhooks should enforce a clear egress policy that prevents access to loopback, link-local, RFC1918, cluster-local, or otherwise internal destinations, including redirects and DNS changes after validation.

Observed: `validateWebhookURL` checks only non-empty, `https://`, and `url.Parse`. Production starts the delivery worker whenever dashboard webhooks are enabled. The worker uses a default `http.Client`, so redirect behavior is unrestricted by this code. The tests cover only plain-HTTP rejection, not private hosts, redirect chains, DNS rebinding, or embedded credentials.

Impact: an authenticated dashboard user can turn the API worker into an outbound network probe or request relay against internal HTTPS services, and redirect handling expands the reachable surface beyond the initially submitted URL. That is a control-plane boundary violation, especially on hosts that can reach internal storage, observability, or admin services already exposed in other findings.

Remediation direction: add destination policy enforcement at both registration and send time: reject local/private/reserved IP ranges after DNS resolution, reject userinfo, constrain ports if appropriate, disable or strictly validate redirects, and re-resolve on delivery. Add unit/integration tests for loopback, RFC1918, link-local, redirect-to-private, and DNS-rebinding-style cases.

### F-1246. API design docs still say webhook callbacks are not in v1 even though dashboard webhook CRUD, worker, and runbooks have shipped

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `docs/reference/api-design.md`
- `docs/reference/api/rates-engine.v1.yaml`
- `internal/api/v1/dashboardwebhooks/doc.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-api/main.go`
- `docs/operations/runbooks/customer-webhook-delivery-failing.md`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0038`
- `EV-0072`

Expected: the API-design reference should match the current product contract after a previously deferred capability ships.

Observed: the design doc's "Open questions — closed" section still says "Webhook callbacks? Not in v1. Customers who want push use SSE." The current API reference, route mounts, delivery worker, and operations runbook all describe a shipped dashboard webhook callback feature.

Impact: integrators, operators, and auditors get contradictory answers about whether push callbacks exist, which complicates product positioning and weakens confidence in docs as a source of truth during security and launch review.

Remediation direction: update the API design reference to reflect the shipped dashboard webhook model, document how it relates to SSE, and make design-reference drift part of the docs-truth checks for features that move from deferred to shipped.

### F-1247. Customer webhook delivery rows are not atomically claimed, so multiple API workers can emit duplicate callbacks for the same attempt

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `cmd/ratesengine-api/main.go`
- `internal/customerwebhook/worker.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/webhook_store.go`
- `docs/architecture/r2-r3-bringup.md`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0039`
- `EV-0073`

Expected: each pending webhook delivery attempt should be claimed once before network I/O so horizontal API scale or multi-region rollout does not multiply customer callbacks.

Observed: every API process with dashboard webhooks enabled starts its own worker. `ListPendingDeliveries` fetches due rows with a plain SELECT, without a lease, claim update, or `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`; the worker performs the HTTP POST and only afterwards marks the row delivered or failed. Two workers can therefore read and send the same pending row concurrently. The package comment explicitly assumes one worker and calls duplicate delivery cosmetically harmless.

Impact: duplicate SEV/anomaly/divergence callbacks can hit customer automation, paging, or Slack/Discord sinks during routine horizontal scaling, blue/green deploy overlap, or the documented R2/R3 rollout. That is a correctness and customer-trust issue, especially for incident automation.

Remediation direction: add atomic claim semantics before outbound POSTs. Good options are a transactional `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` plus state transition, or a claim/lease column with compare-and-swap updates and expiry recovery. Add concurrency tests with two workers racing the same due row and assert exactly one POST per scheduled attempt.

### F-1248. The documented ten-webhook-per-account limit is enforced with a raceable pre-check, so concurrent creates can exceed the cap

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/dashboardwebhooks/handlers.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/webhook_store.go`
- `migrations/0027_platform_v1_schema.up.sql`
- `internal/api/v1/dashboardwebhooks/handlers_test.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0040`
- `EV-0074`

Expected: the advertised per-account webhook ceiling should remain true under concurrent requests, not just serial UI use.

Observed: `HandleCreate` calls `checkQuota`, which loads current account hooks and compares `len(hooks)` to ten, then later performs a separate store insert. The Postgres store is a plain insert path, migration 0027 has no database-side cap, and the current quota test exercises only sequential creation.

Impact: a customer or script issuing parallel create requests can exceed the service's own control-plane limit, growing outbound delivery fan-out, SSRF exposure, and incident-notification noise beyond the bounded posture the code comments promise.

Remediation direction: move quota enforcement into an atomic database/store operation. A transactional account-level advisory lock or row lock plus count-and-insert, or another explicit compare-and-insert design, is materially stronger than a handler-side pre-check. Add concurrency tests that launch more than ten creates in parallel and prove the persisted count never exceeds ten.

### F-1249. Customer webhook callbacks are exposed and operated as a shipped feature, but no production code enqueues any delivery events

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/platform/webhook.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/webhook_store.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-api/main.go`
- `internal/api/v1/dashboardwebhooks/doc.go`
- `openapi/rates-engine.v1.yaml`
- `docs/operations/runbooks/customer-webhook-delivery-failing.md`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0041`
- `EV-0076`

Expected: once customers can register event subscriptions and operators monitor webhook delivery health, the product must actually fan incident/anomaly/divergence events into the delivery queue.

Observed: the codebase defines event types, accepts them in dashboard CRUD, exposes them in OpenAPI, starts a queue-draining worker, and publishes a runbook for delivery failures. But a repo-wide source search finds `EnqueueDelivery` only at its interface/store implementation and tests/fakes; no production event producer inserts pending rows for `incident.sev1`, `incident.resolved`, `anomaly.freeze`, or `divergence.firing`.

Impact: customers can configure a callback feature that never receives real product events, while operators can watch worker metrics and runbooks that appear to describe a live system. That is a shipped-surface correctness failure and a direct customer-trust risk.

Remediation direction: implement the missing producer side explicitly. Wire concrete incident/anomaly/divergence event sources to a fan-out service that filters subscribed enabled hooks and calls `EnqueueDelivery` once per target webhook, with idempotency and observability. Add integration tests that trigger each event class and assert delivery rows are created before the worker runs.

### F-1250. Freeze-event open-row dedupe is raceable, so concurrent same-pair freezes can create multiple still-firing durable rows

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/aggregate/freeze/freeze.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/freeze_events.go`
- `test/integration/freeze_events_test.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0042`
- `EV-0079`

Expected: while one `(asset, quote)` pair is already frozen, concurrent refreshes should preserve exactly one open durable `freeze_events` row for that pair.

Observed: `FreezeEventSink.RecordFreeze` comments say the idempotency check and insert happen "in the same transaction," but the implementation issues a single unlocked `INSERT ... SELECT ... WHERE NOT EXISTS (...) ON CONFLICT (...) DO NOTHING`. The `freeze_events` primary key includes `frozen_at`, so two concurrent callers with different timestamps can both evaluate `NOT EXISTS` before either row is visible and insert distinct open rows. The current integration test proves only sequential idempotency.

Impact: the anomaly timeline can overcount active freeze incidents for a pair, open-row monitoring can inflate, and recovery semantics rely on a later bulk update cleaning up duplicate history that should not exist in the first place.

Remediation direction: make "one open row per pair" a real database invariant. A partial unique index on `(asset_id, quote_id) WHERE recovered_at IS NULL`, or an equivalent transactional lock/UPSERT design, would close the race. Add concurrent integration coverage that fires multiple same-pair freezes together and asserts exactly one open row persists.

### F-1251. FX-based `usd_volume` enrichment rejects historical-but-valid rates because freshness is measured against wall-clock time instead of the trade timestamp

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `cmd/ratesengine-indexer/main.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/usd_fx_resolver.go`
- `internal/storage/timescale/trades.go`
- `test/integration/usd_fx_resolver_test.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0043`
- `EV-0080`

Expected: when resolving USD volume for a trade at timestamp `T`, staleness should be evaluated relative to `T` (or another clearly documented trade-time policy), so valid historical/backfilled trades can still inherit a contemporaneous FX/VWAP anchor.

Observed: `VWAPUSDFXResolver.queryDB` correctly finds the latest peg VWAP at-or-before the supplied trade timestamp, but `USDPriceAt` rejects it using `r.clock().Sub(observedAt) > freshness`. That compares the row to wall-clock now, not to the trade timestamp. Any trade older than the one-hour default window can therefore lose Phase-2 USD enrichment even when the at-time rate exists. The same file documents `Freshness: 0` as disabling the check, while the constructor interprets zero as "apply the 1h default"; the integration test relies on the documented disable behavior and currently fails.

Impact: historical replay, backfill, and delayed indexing can systematically under-populate `trades.usd_volume` for non-USD quotes covered by the new FX resolver. Downstream 24h volume, ranking, and transparency surfaces then understate coverage exactly where Phase 2 was intended to improve it.

Reproduction or reasoning path:

- `go test -tags=integration ./test/integration -run TestVWAPUSDFXResolver_QueriesPrices1m -count=1`
- Current result: fails with `expected resolver to find EURC/USDC VWAP, got ok=false`.

Remediation direction: define freshness relative to the requested trade timestamp, not wall-clock process time, and split "unset" from "explicitly disabled" freshness semantics if zero is meant to disable checks. Keep an integration case with an old wall-clock seed but a valid at-trade anchor, and add a second case proving genuinely stale-at-trade anchors are rejected.

### F-1252. Multi-region cutover instructions invoke a nonexistent `make verify-cross-region` launch check

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `docs/operations/multi-region-cutover.md`
- `scripts/dev/verify-cross-region.sh`
- `Makefile`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0044`
- `EV-0082`

Expected: a launch or failover checklist should call a command that exists in the current repository, especially when the step gates cross-region price consistency before a high-risk cutover.

Observed: the Stage 5 pre-flight checklist in `docs/operations/multi-region-cutover.md` says "Cross-region consistency check passes (`make verify-cross-region`, see `scripts/dev/verify-cross-region.sh`)." Repository search finds no `verify-cross-region` target in `Makefile`; only the shell script and direct ops binary commands exist.

Impact: an operator following the cutover playbook gets a Make target failure at the exact moment they need a deterministic consistency check, creating avoidable ambiguity during a regional bring-up or failover drill.

Remediation direction: either add the Make target and keep docs as written, or update every operational reference to the direct script invocation. Keep one canonical command in the runbook and test it from the documented working directory.

### F-1253. Enabling Redis ACL lockdown disables the default user, but the rendered application config never sets `redis_username`, so binaries keep authenticating on the rejected legacy path

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `configs/ansible/roles/redis-sentinel/templates/users.acl.j2`
- `configs/ansible/roles/redis-sentinel/templates/redis.conf.j2`
- `configs/ansible/roles/redis-sentinel/defaults/main.yml`
- `configs/ansible/roles/archival-node/templates/ratesengine.toml.j2`
- `internal/config/config.go`
- `internal/storage/redisclient/redisclient.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0045`
- `EV-0083`

Expected: the same deployment toggle that enables Redis ACL lockdown should also render application client config that authenticates as the ACL user the server now requires.

Observed: `redis_acl_lockdown: true` renders an ACL file that turns `user default off` and creates `user ratesengine on >{{ redis_password }}`. The Redis client builder supports ACL usernames through `StorageConfig.RedisUsername`, and docs say it must be set to `ratesengine` under lockdown. But the Ansible-owned `ratesengine.toml.j2` storage block renders `redis_addr` and secrets only; it never writes `redis_username = "ratesengine"` or an equivalent variable, and repo search finds no deployment template path that does.

Impact: flipping the hardening flag can strand the API/indexer/aggregator on password-only default-user auth exactly after the server side disables that user. Depending on the binary and feature, this can break Redis-backed rate limiting, signup abuse controls, SEP-10 replay protection, streaming fan-out/subscription, freeze markers, and aggregator cache publication during a supposed security hardening rollout.

Remediation direction: couple the ACL flag to rendered client identity. Add an explicit Ansible variable for the application Redis ACL username, render it into `ratesengine.toml.j2`, and gate lockdown rollout on dry-run/startup probes that authenticate through the exact rendered config. Add a config/template test that rejects `redis_acl_lockdown: true` with an empty application username.

### F-1254. Redis ACL lockdown allows stale or wrong key families, so hardened deployments still deny active runtime namespaces after the username handoff is fixed

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `configs/ansible/roles/redis-sentinel/templates/users.acl.j2`
- `internal/ratelimit/bucket.go`
- `internal/cachekeys/keys.go`
- `internal/auth/signup_tracker.go`
- `internal/auth/sep10/redisreplay.go`
- `internal/usage/counter.go`
- `cmd/ratesengine-api/main.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0046`
- `EV-0084`

Expected: the Redis ACL policy should grant exactly the application namespaces the current binaries actually use, with repo-controlled tests preventing template drift when key families are added, renamed, or retired.

Observed: the lockdown ACL permits `~ratelimit:*` and `~subscriber:*`, but current runtime code writes `rl:*` rate-limit counters and `sub:*` SSE subscriber presence keys. It also omits active namespaces entirely for `signup:email:*`, `sep10:seen:*`, `usage:*`, `assets:list:*`, and `markets:list:*`. The API binary wires those paths whenever Redis is configured, so a hardened deployment can authenticate successfully and still hit Redis ACL denials on live features.

Impact: operators can believe Redis ACL lockdown is safely enabled after fixing the username defect, while rate limiting, signup duplicate tracking, SEP-10 replay protection, usage accounting, subscriber presence tracking, and catalogue cache population are denied at runtime. The result mixes security-control degradation with customer-visible feature breakage during a hardening rollout.

Remediation direction: derive the ACL allow-list from a reviewed Redis namespace inventory instead of hand-maintained free text, fix the stale/missing patterns, and add a CI check that compares rendered ACL patterns against code-owned production key builders plus any explicitly documented namespaces. Validate a lockdown-on rendered config against an integration harness that exercises rate limiting, signup/SEP-10 guards, usage reads, SSE presence writes, and catalogue cache writes.

### F-1255. Concurrent first-login callbacks for the same new email can create orphan accounts and return a 500 because provisioning is not atomic per email

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/dashboardauth/handlers.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/token_store.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/account_store.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/user_store.go`
- `migrations/0027_platform_v1_schema.up.sql`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0047`
- `EV-0086`
- `EV-0087`

Expected: first-login provisioning for one email should converge on one account/user result even if multiple valid magic links are consumed in parallel. The flow should be transactional or retry idempotently on the email uniqueness boundary.

Observed: multiple magic links can exist for the same unregistered email. Each callback consumes its own token atomically, then performs `GetUserByEmail`; if no user exists yet, it creates an account row before creating the user row. Under concurrency, two callbacks can both see no user, each create an account, and the losing user insert then fail on `users_email_idx`. Because `signupNewUser` retries account slug conflicts by creating a suffixed slug, the second account row can remain committed even though its owner user was never created.

Impact: first login can return an internal error for one of two legitimate concurrent clicks, and the database accumulates orphan free-tier accounts that do not correspond to an actual user. That pollutes customer/account reporting and makes later cleanup or billing migration harder than it should be.

Remediation direction: move new-user provisioning behind one transactional/idempotent persistence boundary keyed by normalized email. Acceptable shapes include a single transaction that creates-or-loads the user/account pair, or a retry-on-unique-email path that discards the speculative account and reloads the winner. Add an integration test that consumes two distinct same-email tokens concurrently and asserts one logical account/user result with no orphan account rows.

### F-1256. Dashboard key-rate UI and OpenAPI still promise generic 1000/100000 limits even though the backend now silently clamps by account tier

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `web/dashboard/src/app/keys/page.tsx`
- `openapi/rates-engine.v1.yaml`
- `internal/api/v1/dashboardkeys/handlers.go`
- `internal/platform/account.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0048`
- `EV-0090`

Expected: the dashboard and published API contract should describe the actual persisted key-budget semantics customers observe after creation, including the current tier-specific caps.

Observed: the backend now clamps dashboard-created key budgets by tier, but the dashboard form still labels the free-tier default as `1000`, exposes a generic `max={100000}` numeric field to every user, and sends that value unchanged. OpenAPI says `rate_limit_per_min` has `Default 1000` and `maximum: 100000`, without describing the server-side tier clamp. A Free customer can therefore submit a value that the product surface implies is normal, then receive a created key whose persisted budget is silently reduced to 60/min.

Impact: the fixed security boundary is now paired with a product-contract mismatch. Customers and support can disagree about what was requested versus what was stored, and API consumers generated from the published schema have no way to infer that the backend may materially downgrade the submitted value by tier.

Remediation direction: make one truth surface win. Either remove the customer-controlled raw input and render the effective tier budget directly, or keep the input but explain exact clamping semantics in both UI and OpenAPI, including the per-tier ceiling and whether the response returns the effective persisted value. Add UI/spec tests that pin the Free-tier copy to the backend cap ladder.

### F-1257. The 25-active-key/account dashboard quota is enforced with a raceable pre-check, so concurrent creates can exceed the advertised cap

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `internal/api/v1/dashboardkeys/handlers.go`
- `internal/api/v1/dashboardkeys/handlers_test.go`
- `internal/platform/postgresstore/apikey_store.go`
- `migrations/0027_platform_v1_schema.up.sql`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0049`
- `EV-0092`

Expected: the dashboard's active-key cap should hold under concurrent requests, not only under serial UX flows.

Observed: `HandleCreate` calls `checkQuota`, which lists all account keys and counts those with zero `RevokedAt`. If the count is below 25, the handler later performs an independent insert through `APIKeyStore.Create`. The schema provides active-key indexes but no database invariant or transactional compare-and-insert guard for the 25-row ceiling. Current tests only pre-seed 25 rows and verify a single follow-up create returns 409.

Impact: coordinated or accidental concurrent create requests can leave an account with more active dashboard keys than the product promises. That weakens the anti-sprawl ceiling operators rely on for customer-key hygiene and makes later cleanup/reporting less trustworthy.

Remediation direction: enforce the cap atomically at the persistence boundary. Use a transaction with the appropriate account-scoped lock/check, or move the count/create operation into a store method that serializes per-account create semantics. Add a concurrent create test that starts below the threshold and proves persisted active keys never exceed 25.

### F-1258. Redis-less API deployments still wire a non-nil usage middleware around a nil Redis client, so authenticated requests can panic instead of degrading cleanly

Severity: `high`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `cmd/ratesengine-api/main.go`
- `internal/api/v1/middleware/usage.go`
- `internal/usage/counter.go`
- `internal/api/v1/server.go`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0050`
- `EV-0094`

Expected: when API Redis is not configured, optional Redis-backed features should either be omitted cleanly or become explicit no-ops. An authenticated request should not cross into a nil Redis client because startup accepted that deployment mode.

Observed: `redisclient.Build` may return nil and the API still proceeds. Later, `usageCounter := usage.New(rdb)` executes unconditionally and `middleware.UsageTracker(usageCounter, ...)` is always passed into the server. The middleware skips only when the `*usage.Counter` itself is nil, but here it is non-nil with a nil embedded Redis client. Once an authenticated request finishes its handler path, `UsageTracker` calls `counter.Increment`, which dereferences `c.rdb.TxPipeline()` directly.

Impact: a Redis-less API deployment that is otherwise intended to stay online can panic during authenticated traffic while processing best-effort usage metering. That breaks the documented optional-Redis degradation model and turns an observability add-on into a request-path reliability hazard.

Remediation direction: make the optionality real. Either only construct/pass a usage counter when Redis exists, or make `usage.Counter` explicitly nil-safe and have the middleware treat nil-backed counters as disabled. Add an API wiring test for `rdb=nil` that exercises an authenticated request through the full middleware stack without panic.

### F-1259. `/v1/account/usage` docs and generated references still call the endpoint always-empty even though current runtime wiring can return real Redis-backed daily counts

Severity: `medium`

Status: `open`

Affected surface:

- `cmd/ratesengine-api/main.go`
- `internal/api/v1/account.go`
- `internal/api/v1/server.go`
- `openapi/rates-engine.v1.yaml`
- `docs/reference/api/rates-engine.v1.yaml`
- `docs/reference/api-design.md`
- `docs/reference/api/postman-collection.json`
- `docs/architecture/explorer-data-inventory.md`

Evidence:

- `XFI-0051`
- `EV-0095`

Expected: once the usage reader is live in current runtime wiring, customer-facing docs and generated references should describe conditional real data semantics instead of the retired stub contract.

Observed: `ratesengine-api` wires `UsageTracker` and `UsageReader`, and `handleAccountUsage` now reads a trailing 30-day usage window when the reader is present. Yet its own doc comment still says the endpoint always returns `[]`, the OpenAPI summary says "currently empty," the generated reference YAML/Postman artifacts copy that contract, and the API design / explorer inventory docs still call it a placeholder or stub.

Impact: customers and internal reviewers are told a live usage feature is absent, while generated clients and product documentation remain anchored to outdated behavior. That distorts product readiness judgments and makes future audit/review work easier to misread.

Remediation direction: rewrite the usage contract around current conditional semantics: Redis-backed deployments return trailing daily counts, deployments without a reader return an empty list, and `from`/`to` remain reserved if that is still the implementation choice. Regenerate all derived API reference artifacts from the corrected OpenAPI source.
