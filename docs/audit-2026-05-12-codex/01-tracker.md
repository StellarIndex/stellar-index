# Master Tracker

Audit label: `2026-05-12-codex`

Plan prepared: `2026-05-11`

Snapshot anchor: `80c57e38eeee729ec2d879d54286419206cee864`

## Workspace Controls

| Control | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Audit mode | Cold, adversarial, zero-trust toward docs and prior findings |
| Prior audit use | Format and checklist inspiration only |
| Current findings imported | none |
| Tracked file source | `git ls-files` |
| Tracked file count before this directory | `1,747` |
| Execution-time scope drift | current `HEAD` advanced to `6e873cac...`; the inventory was refreshed/merged back to parity at `1,869` tracked rows on 2026-05-12; see `EV-0063` and `EV-0078` |
| File inventory | [inventory/file-coverage.tsv](inventory/file-coverage.tsv) |
| Evidence ledger | [evidence/log.md](evidence/log.md) |
| Command ledger | [evidence/commands.md](evidence/commands.md) |
| Cross-file ledger | [evidence/cross-file-interactions.md](evidence/cross-file-interactions.md) |
| Findings ledger | [05-findings-register.md](05-findings-register.md) |
| Exclusions ledger | [06-exclusions-register.md](06-exclusions-register.md) |

## Planning Outcome

| Item | State | Notes |

| R1 runtime queried | complete | Read-only service, firewall, timer, health, capacity, alert, Caddy, SSE, history, and price-parity probes recorded in [evidence/r1-runtime.md](evidence/r1-runtime.md) |
| Plan second pass | complete | Scope reconciled against tracked top-level file counts |
| Plan third pass | complete | Additional competitive, R1, web, and cross-file gates added |
