# Reconciliation And Multi-Pass Checks

This file is the audit quality gate. It must be updated after each
major pass and again at closure.

## Initial Scope Reconciliation

Generated from `git ls-files` before this audit directory was added.

| Every tracked file is represented in inventory | complete | `EV-0078` refresh/merge restored 1,869 tracked rows for 1,869 current files |
| Every Go package is represented in a workstream | todo | Compare `go list ./...` to W06-W20 |
| Every binary has a journey or operator flow | todo | `cmd/*` to J45-J56 and API/data journeys |
| Every migration has a store/API/test review path | todo | W12 and J45 |
| Every workflow has script/artifact/deploy review path | todo | W03, W20, W23 |
| Every frontend route class has API/data review path | todo | W16 and J37-J44 |
| Every monitoring rule has metric and runbook review path | todo | W17 |
| Every public docs family has docs-truth review path | todo | W21 |
| Every competitive product surface has owner | todo | W22 |

## Third-Pass Checklist

| Check | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| No file inventory rows remain `todo` | todo | Closure gate |
| No file inventory rows remain `in_progress` | todo | Closure gate |
| Every `blocked` row has exclusion entry | todo | Closure gate |
| Every `excluded` row has exclusion entry | todo | Closure gate |
| Every finding has evidence refs | todo | Closure gate |
| Every evidence ref has primary source anchors | todo | Closure gate |
| Every journey has evidence or explicit exclusion | todo | Closure gate |
| Every severity was challenged once | todo | Adversarial review |
| Docs-only claims were removed or marked unverified | todo | Cold-audit rule |
| R1 checks are complete or explicitly excluded | todo | Runtime gate |
| Prior audit findings were not imported | complete | Plan contains no prior findings |
| Plan covers generic market-data parity | complete | W11, W15, W16, W22 |
| Plan covers Stellar-native superiority | complete | W06, W08-W10, W14, W18, W22 |

## Reconciliation Notes

Add dated notes here during execution. Do not mark closure gates complete
without evidence IDs.

### 2026-05-11 Plan Second Pass

- `EV-0003` verifies the generated inventory row count matches the
  tracked file count: `1,747` rows for `1,747` tracked files in scope.
- All top-level tracked areas have workstream ownership in the initial
  scope table.
- The execution checklist remains open because the audit itself has not
  been performed.

### 2026-05-11 Plan Third Pass

- `EV-0004` verifies every inventory row remains `todo`, preventing the
  plan from falsely claiming completed file review.
- The findings register is intentionally empty and imports no prior
  findings.
- The plan adds explicit gates for generic market-data parity,
  Stellar-native depth, R1 runtime checks, frontend/product surfaces,
  generated artifact drift, and cross-file interactions.

### 2026-05-12 Execution Reconciliation

- Cold execution evidence now spans `CMD-0007` through `CMD-0084`,
  `EV-0005` through `EV-0081`, `R1-0001` through `R1-0018`, and
  `XFI-0001` through `XFI-0043`.
- Findings `F-1201` through `F-1251` remain evidence-backed and are
  mapped to remediation rows `R-1201` through `R-1249`; `F-1202` is
  now marked `fixed` because R1 caught up to the route removal during
  the audit window.
- Live R1 checks covered process state, timers, firewall/listeners,
  external reachability, host capacity, Prometheus alerts, config
  snippets, Caddy drift, API/history/SSE behavior, and stablecoin
  price parity.
- The audit found additional areas beyond the initial plan while
  executing: Docker migration-image bootstrapping, SSE server
  timeouts, CDN verification script drift, backfill depth, PR-only CI
  under unprotected main, stablecoin price cross-surface mismatch,
  SDEX legacy-claim backfill loss, oracle partial-coverage drift,
  external streamer parse-error observability, supply component
  freshness, CMC identity ambiguity, API Redis optionality,
  ops WASM progress-counter crash behavior, Docker Go toolchain
  drift, migration-index drift between shipped SQL and the
  operator-facing schema inventory, contribution-history rows that
  persist without their advertised USD-volume field, and classic
  asset registry metadata that freezes after the first same-process
  observation. The moving `HEAD` also surfaced newly landed dashboard
  webhook security/correctness seams: stored signing-key material is
  misdescribed as hash-only, URL validation leaves an SSRF-capable
  outbound worker path, quota enforcement races under concurrent create
  requests, and the callback queue currently has no production event
  producer at all. The follow-on new-runtime pass also found raceable
  freeze-event open-row dedupe and a verified failing integration path in
  FX-derived `usd_volume` freshness handling.
- `CMD-0084` reran `./scripts/ci/lint-docs.sh` after the latest ledger
  updates and passed.
- Closure caveat: the TSV remains the per-file coverage control. Rows
  with `todo` still require terminal file-level review before claiming
  literal every-file closure. `EV-0063` documented the scope drift when
  the repository advanced from the original `80c57e...` anchor to
  current `6e873cac...`; `EV-0078` resolves that count mismatch by
  refreshing and merging the inventory back to `1,869` tracked rows.
  Current findings remain source/R1 verified and not imported from prior
  audits, but final whole-repo closure still requires terminal review
  status across the refreshed TSV.
