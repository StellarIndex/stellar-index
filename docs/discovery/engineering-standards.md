# Engineering standards

**Status:** ✅ Design-locked policy. Every PR, every release, every
piece of documentation, every doc reviewer, and every agent working
on this codebase is bound by this doc. Complements
[repo-structure-plan.md](repo-structure-plan.md) — the repo is the
skeleton; these standards are the muscle.

**User directive** (2026-04-22):

> "Make sure we have a plan on how to keep the repo really free of
> technical debt and designed to an enterprise level and easily
> understood by agents and preventing docs drift etc."

Four goals. This doc is accountable to each of them, enumerated:

1. **Technical-debt-free** — never accumulate; pay as you go.
2. **Enterprise-grade** — operational rigour, not heroics.
3. **Agent-readable** — AI tooling can reason about the codebase
   without tribal knowledge.
4. **Doc-drift-proof** — every doc is either current, generated,
   or archived.

---

## 1. Core principle: boring over clever

Every "should we do X?" question defaults to:

> "Is there a dumber version that works? Use that."

A boring, well-documented pattern beats a clever, subtle one every
time. We reach for clever only when we've shown concretely that
boring fails — and we document that failure in an ADR so the
cleverness is justified.

The rest of this doc is mostly mechanical enforcement of this
principle.

---

## 2. Technical debt prevention

### 2.1. Definition of Done

A PR is mergeable **only** when all of these are true. CI enforces
the mechanical ones; reviewers enforce the judgement ones.

**Mechanical (CI-enforced):**

- [ ] `go vet` passes.
- [ ] `gofumpt -l` returns nothing.
- [ ] `golangci-lint run` passes (config in `.golangci.yml`).
- [ ] `goarchlint` passes — no illegal dependency crosses.
- [ ] Unit tests pass with `-race` flag.
- [ ] Coverage does not decrease on changed packages.
- [ ] `govulncheck` passes.
- [ ] `gitleaks` finds no secrets.
- [ ] New exported symbol has a doc comment (`golint` enforces).
- [ ] If `openapi/*.yaml` changed: Spectral lint passes + generated
      reference docs regenerated.
- [ ] If a config field added: `make docs-config` regenerates
      without delta.

**Judgement (reviewer-enforced):**

- [ ] New public API accompanied by usage doc (`docs/reference/` or
      `pkg/client/README.md`).
- [ ] Bug fix accompanied by a regression test.
- [ ] ADR proposed for any architectural decision (new source, new
      storage tier, new external dep).
- [ ] No `TODO` / `FIXME` without a linked issue number.
- [ ] No commented-out code except via `// nolint` with a reason.
- [ ] Runbook exists for any new alert.
- [ ] Docstrings explain **why**, not **what**.

### 2.2. Forbidden patterns

The following trigger automatic PR blocks:

- **`interface{}` / `any` in `pkg/*`** — public API must be
  strongly typed. In `internal/` allowed only with a code comment
  justifying it, nothing structural.
- **`panic()` outside `main()` and tests** — library code returns
  errors; `cmd/*` may panic only during startup.
- **`init()` functions that do more than assign constants or
  register standard handlers.** Hidden start-time magic is agent-
  hostile and test-hostile.
- **Goroutines without explicit context + shutdown** — every `go`
  statement must take `context.Context` and honour `ctx.Done()`.
- **SQL string concatenation** — parameterised queries only;
  `sqlclosecheck` lint catches unclosed rows.
- **`time.Now()` inside business logic** — clock passed in as
  dependency for testability.
- **Global mutable state** — use `sync.Map` or channel-based state
  if unavoidable; prefer explicit dependency injection.
- **Dependency with < 1 GitHub star or < 1 year of history** —
  unless justified in an ADR with the alternative considered.

### 2.3. `TODO` discipline

- Every `TODO` / `FIXME` / `XXX` in code has the form:

  ```go
  // TODO(#123): description
  ```

  where `#123` is a tracked issue. CI regex-checks this pattern.

- `TODO`s without issues are a **broken build**. We ship clean code
  or a tracked deficit, never a muddy middle.

### 2.4. Deprecation policy

1. Mark deprecated with a clear Godoc comment:

   ```go
   // Deprecated: use NewFoo (ADR-0017). Will be removed in v3.0.0.
   ```

2. Call sites in the repo migrate within the same minor version.

3. Public deprecations are documented in CHANGELOG **and** a
   dedicated `docs/reference/deprecations.md` table.

4. Removal at the next major version at the earliest — never
   sooner than 90 days after deprecation landed.

5. No "we've been planning to remove this for two years" —
   deprecations have a scheduled removal version from day one.

### 2.5. Dependency minimalism

- Every direct dep in `go.mod` has either:
  - An ADR justifying it, **or**
  - A single-line comment in `go.mod` pointing to the package
    using it (for trivial deps like `testify`).
- `go mod tidy` in CI fails the build if unused deps linger.
- `govulncheck` flags vulnerable versions; we patch within 7 days
  for HIGH/CRITICAL, 30 days for MEDIUM, at will for LOW.
- Transitive dep explosions (`go mod graph` > N nodes for a given
  leaf dep) trigger a review: is this library pulling too much?

### 2.6. Feature flag hygiene

Feature flags are **not** a tech-debt accumulator. Rules:

- Every flag has an owner, a default, and a **scheduled removal
  date** — a labelled issue that expires the flag.
- The flag registry `internal/config/flags.go` contains a struct
  with every flag + its metadata. CI builds a doc from it.
- A flag older than **90 days past its removal date** triggers a
  build warning. 180 days: build failure.
- Kill-switches (for ops) are a different flavour — they live
  forever but must be documented in a runbook.

### 2.7. No "temporary" workarounds

Every workaround for an upstream bug / limitation has:

1. A link to the upstream issue.
2. A code comment with the link.
3. A tracked issue in our tracker labelled `workaround`.
4. A removal test: when upstream fixes, CI finds the workaround
   and suggests removal.

We do not carry workarounds indefinitely.

### 2.8. Refactor-as-you-go

- If a module is confusing when you touch it, fix the confusion in
  the same PR **or** in an immediate follow-up within 1 week.
- Never "we'll clean this up later" as the last line of a PR
  description. Later is this PR or next sprint, explicitly
  scheduled.

### 2.9. Code review standards

- **Every PR is reviewed by a CODEOWNER** for the touched
  packages.
- **PRs > 500 LoC diff are split** unless reviewer explicitly
  agrees in advance.
- **Review within 24 h** (business days). Escalate in the team
  channel if stuck.
- **Approval != merge** — only the PR author merges, after
  approval, with CI green. No "emergency bypass" without the
  tech lead's explicit pre-authorised sign-off.

---

## 3. Enterprise-grade engineering practices

### 3.1. SLOs as code

- Every customer-facing endpoint has an SLO defined in
  `internal/obs/slo.go`:

  ```go
  var APIv1TradesSLO = obs.SLO{
      Name:           "api.v1.trades.latency.p95",
      Target:         200 * time.Millisecond,
      Window:         30 * 24 * time.Hour,
      ErrorBudget:    1.0 - 0.999,
      PageOnBurn:     obs.BurnRate2xOver1h,
  }
  ```

- Prometheus alerts are derived from this struct. Runbooks are
  linked from the struct's `Runbook` field.

- No ad-hoc alerts; everything flows from an SLO.

### 3.2. Runbooks, not tribal knowledge

- Every alert references a runbook path: `docs/operations/runbooks/<name>.md`.
- Every runbook references the SLO + alert it's the response to.
- CI enforces the bidirectional link.
- A runbook has a standard structure:

  ```markdown
  # Runbook: <alert name>

  ## Alert description
  ## When this fires
  ## What it means for users
  ## How to investigate (commands, dashboards)
  ## How to mitigate (commands, config toggles)
  ## How to escalate
  ## Post-mortem notes from prior firings
  ```

- Post-mortem notes append-only; old incidents provide context for
  new responders.

### 3.3. Change management

- **All production changes go through CI.** Zero SSH-to-box
  hotfixes.
- Emergency fixes have an expedited path (single reviewer, small
  PR) but still CI, still PR.
- Config changes go through `configs/*.yaml` with migrations
  testing; not "I edited it live."

### 3.4. Release discipline

- Tag = release. No "in-between unreleased in prod" state.
- Release notes are auto-generated from CHANGELOG's `[Unreleased]`
  section via the `release.yml` workflow.
- Rollback procedure documented per release in
  `docs/operations/rollback/<version>.md`.
- Every release has a "canary window" — 24 h on staging before
  production cutover.

### 3.5. On-call rotation

- At launch: @ash + @alex split 24/7.
- Post-launch: hire the third engineer, rotate 3-person weekly.
- **Never solo on-call longer than 1 week**.
- On-call escalation chain published at
  `docs/operations/escalation.md` — kept current as team changes.

### 3.6. Post-mortem policy

- Every SEV-1 → blameless post-mortem within 5 business days.
- Every SEV-2 → post-mortem within 10 business days.
- Post-mortem template in `docs/operations/post-mortems/_template.md`.
- Published post-mortems (redacting sensitive info) in
  `docs/operations/post-mortems/<date>-<slug>.md`.
- Action items from post-mortems tracked as issues; never "we'll
  remember to fix that."

### 3.7. Capacity review on every release

A 1-paragraph note in every release:

```
Traffic headroom: currently serving P of peak; capacity for N×P.
Timescale storage headroom: X TB used / Y TB capacity.
Trigger for next scale-out: Z.
```

Prevents the "we were surprised by growth" class of incident.

### 3.8. Vendor / supplier review

- **Annual review of every external dependency** (cloud, colo,
  secret manager, CDN, FX/CEX data provider).
- Check: pricing changes, API deprecations, SLA changes, security
  advisories, competitive alternatives.
- Output: `docs/operations/vendor-review-<year>.md`.

---

## 4. Agent-readability

New constraint from the modern reality of AI-assisted coding. The
repo must be navigable by an LLM (Claude, an agent framework,
a GPT-derived assistant) without that assistant needing tribal
knowledge.

### 4.1. `CLAUDE.md` at repo root

File name is `CLAUDE.md` (matches withObsrvr and others' convention
— we've seen it read by agents in the wild). Its job:

> "If an AI agent opens this repo cold, this file tells them
> everything they need to find their way."

Contents:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md — repo orientation for AI agents

## What this repo is

Rates Engine — a Stellar asset pricing API. Ingests on-chain and
off-chain price data, aggregates into VWAP/TWAP/OHLC, serves via
REST + SSE.

## Build + test commands

make dev            # stand up full stack locally
make test           # unit tests, ~2 min
make lint           # golangci-lint + gofumpt check
make build          # all binaries into bin/
make docs-all       # regenerate docs/reference/

## Repo map

cmd/                one dir per binary (indexer / aggregator / api / ops / migrate)
internal/           private packages; cannot be imported externally
  canonical/        core types: Trade, Price, Asset, Pair, Amount
  sources/<proto>/  one package per on-chain or off-chain source
  aggregate/        VWAP/TWAP/outlier/triangulation
  storage/          TimescaleDB + Redis + MinIO adapters
  api/              REST handlers (v1)
pkg/                public surface: client SDK + stable types
docs/               architecture + ADR + operations + reference
migrations/         golang-migrate SQL migrations
openapi/            the API spec (source of truth for reference docs)

## Invariants that must never be violated

1. **i128 / u128 are never int64.** Token amounts, reserves,
   prices from Soroban are `*big.Int` in Go, NUMERIC in Postgres,
   strings in JSON. See ADR-0003.
2. **Horizon is not a component.** We do not ingest from Horizon,
   run Horizon, or proxy to Horizon. See ADR-0001.
3. **MinIO, not local filesystem, for Galexie storage.** See
   ADR-0002.
4. **Every exported symbol has a Godoc comment.** Lint-enforced.
5. **No new interface{}/any in pkg/*.** See §2.2 of engineering-standards.md.

## Common tasks

- Add a new CEX connector: see docs/development/contributing-a-source.md.
- Add a new on-chain DEX: same doc.
- Investigate a price divergence: docs/operations/runbooks/price-divergence.md.
- Why is `<metric>` alerting: docs/operations/runbooks/<metric>.md.

## Known footguns

- SoroswapPair.SwapEvent has no reserves — use the sibling SyncEvent
  correlated by (ledger, tx, op_index). See internal/sources/soroswap/README.md.
- Phoenix emits 8 events per swap — use internal/sources/phoenix/correlator.go.
- Reflector v3 has no on-chain twap/x_*. We compute locally.
- Our `ctx-proposal.md` has outstanding corrections — see
  docs/_archive/discovery/proposal-corrections.md.

## Where to ask for help

- Code review: CODEOWNERS
- Operations: #ratesengine-ops channel
- Architecture: ADR process (docs/adr/)
```

This file is maintained by hand; its freshness is checked in CI
(same 90-day rule).

### 4.2. Package-level `doc.go` with `CLAUDE.md`-style intro

Every `internal/` package has a `doc.go` file (Go-native equivalent
of README) with:

```go
// Package sources/soroswap indexes trade and reserve-state events
// from the Soroswap DEX on Stellar Soroban mainnet.
//
// # Architecture
//
// The package subscribes to the Soroswap factory contract's
// `("SoroswapFactory", "new_pair")` events to discover new pairs,
// then subscribes to each pair's `("SoroswapPair", "swap")` and
// `("SoroswapPair", "sync")` events. Swap events and the
// immediately-following Sync events are correlated by
// (ledger, tx_hash, op_index) to produce a CanonicalTrade with
// both the executed amounts and the post-state reserves.
//
// # Public entry points
//
//   - New(deps Deps) Source              — constructs a Source
//   - (*source).StreamLive(ctx, out)     — live subscription
//   - (*source).BackfillRange(ctx, ...)  — historical replay
//
// # Invariants
//
//   - All amounts are decoded as *big.Int (i128). Never int64.
//   - SwapEvent is always paired with a SyncEvent; orphan
//     events are logged and dropped (never fabricated).
//
// # See also
//
//   - docs/architecture/sources/soroswap.md
//   - ADR-0003 (i128 invariant)
//
package soroswap
```

This doc.go is `godoc`-rendered + AI-scannable. Same content
appears in `docs/architecture/sources/soroswap.md` but the source
of truth is the doc.go so drift is impossible.

### 4.3. Consistent naming — no abbreviations

- Exported types: `CanonicalTrade`, not `CTrade` or `CanoTrade`.
- Packages: `canonical`, `aggregate`, `storage` — one word,
  full word, always lowercase.
- Test names: `TestName_Scenario_ExpectedBehaviour` so you can
  grep for behaviour across the codebase.
- Metric names: `ctx_<subsystem>_<noun>_<unit>` — e.g.
  `ctx_ingest_trades_total{source="soroswap"}`.

### 4.4. Structured logs with stable field names

Every log call uses a slog-style structured logger. Field names
are enumerated in `internal/obs/logfields.go`:

```go
const (
    FieldSource      = "source"        // always the source name
    FieldLedgerSeq   = "ledger_seq"    // uint32
    FieldTxHash      = "tx_hash"       // string, hex
    FieldOpIndex     = "op_index"      // int
    FieldAssetKey    = "asset_key"     // canonical asset identifier
    FieldError       = "error"         // %w-wrapped
    // ...
)
```

Any new log field added in a PR must first appear here. Grep
across the repo by field name is reliable, for humans and agents.

### 4.5. Explicit error types

Errors are not just strings. We have a small error taxonomy in
`internal/canonical/errors.go`:

```go
var (
    ErrUnknownAsset     = errors.New("canonical: unknown asset")
    ErrInvalidAmount    = errors.New("canonical: invalid amount")
    ErrI128Overflow     = errors.New("canonical: i128 overflow (this is always a bug)")
    // ...
)
```

Every error returned from internal code either IS one of these
sentinels or WRAPS one. Callers use `errors.Is` to classify.

### 4.6. Machine-readable contracts everywhere

- API: OpenAPI `openapi/rates-engine.v1.yaml`. Source of truth.
  Handlers validated against it in tests.
- Config: JSON-Schema generated from Go struct tags at
  `docs/reference/config/schema.json`.
- Metrics: Prometheus registry dumped to
  `docs/reference/metrics/registry.json`.
- Events we emit: JSON Schema per event type in
  `docs/reference/events/`.

An agent writing a client never guesses shapes.

### 4.7. No hidden conventions

If a pattern is important, it's documented. Examples we make
explicit:

- **`ctx.Context` is always the first argument.** Documented in
  Go style guide we inherit.
- **Errors returned wrapped with `fmt.Errorf("some op: %w", err)`
  format.** Documented in `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Every source's `New(deps Deps)` returns the `Source`
  interface, not the concrete type.** Documented in each
  package's `doc.go`.

### 4.8. Small, focused functions

- Soft limit: 50 lines per function. 100 is a code smell needing
  justification.
- Cyclomatic complexity limit via `gocognit` at 15.
- Long functions get a block-comment table of contents at the top:

  ```go
  // Reconcile walks the three phases:
  //   1. Load in-flight cursor.
  //   2. Fetch any ledger gap from bronze.
  //   3. Materialise silver.
  ```

### 4.9. Prefer composition over generics

Go generics are useful sparingly. Over-using them produces code an
LLM has a harder time reasoning about. Rule: use generics only when
the alternative is interface{}-based type-assertion. Otherwise,
concrete types.

### 4.10. Tests as documentation

- Every exported function has at least one table-driven test with
  named cases.
- Test-case names describe behaviour:

  ```go
  tests := map[string]struct{…}{
      "classic_order_book_trade_produces_canonical_trade":      {...},
      "liquidity_pool_claim_atom_produces_lp_trade":            {...},
      "protocol_18_pre_activation_skips_lp_variant":            {...},
  }
  ```

- Reading tests alone should be enough to understand the public
  API.

---

## 5. Doc-drift prevention (concrete)

Complements `repo-structure-plan.md §6`. Restated compact-form and
with agent-readability additions.

### 5.1. Every doc has exactly one status

Frontmatter YAML:

```yaml
---
title: Soroswap indexing
last_verified: 2026-04-22
verified_by: ash
owners: ['@ash']
supersedes: []
status: current | generated | archived
---
```

- `current` — hand-edited, subject to 90-day staleness check.
- `generated` — regenerated by build step; hand-edits are
  clobbered.
- `archived` — frozen; no staleness check.

One of three, never unlabelled.

### 5.2. Three enforcement layers

1. **CI lint.** `scripts/ci/check-doc-freshness.sh` scans all
   `current` docs, warns at 90 days stale, fails at 180.
2. **Reviewer checklist.** Every PR touching code in a package
   must confirm the package's doc is current (box ticked in PR
   template).
3. **Quarterly sweep.** One calendar day per quarter to walk all
   `current` docs and decide: refresh, archive, delete.

### 5.3. "Never two sources of truth"

If doc A says "the default is 30s" and doc B says "the default is
60s", someone is wrong. Enforcement:

- **Configs:** one YAML with defaults; all docs regenerate from it.
- **Metrics:** one Prometheus registry; all docs regenerate from it.
- **API:** one OpenAPI spec; all docs regenerate from it.
- **Events:** one JSON Schema set; all docs regenerate.

If you find yourself copy-pasting between docs, that's the signal
to factor into a generated source.

### 5.4. "Explain why, not what"

- **What** the code does is visible in the code. Don't duplicate
  in docs.
- **Why** the code does it — the design constraint, the incident
  that motivated a check, the Stellar CAP that requires a decoder
  variant — is invisible. That's what docs are for.

A doc that describes only what the code does is dead weight and
invites drift.

### 5.5. ADR, not casual doc, for decisions

Any time a doc says "we decided" or "we chose X over Y," it is
either an ADR or contains a link to an ADR. Casual narrative about
decisions in architecture docs rots fast; ADRs don't rot because
they don't change.

### 5.6. Auto-generated docs are banner-marked

Every generated file begins:

```markdown
<!-- GENERATED FILE - DO NOT EDIT. Regenerate with `make docs-<name>`. -->
```

Hand-edits are CI-deleted on next regeneration. No "I'll just fix
the typo in the generated file" path.

### 5.7. Doc ownership tracked

CODEOWNERS applies to docs. If you own a package, you own its
architecture doc. If the package changes materially, you update
the doc in the same PR.

---

## 6. Enforcement mechanisms

Summary of how we catch violations. Each link below points to the
mechanism in the codebase.

| Standard | Mechanism | Location |
| -------- | --------- | -------- |
| Boring-over-clever | Code review | CODEOWNERS |
| Definition of Done | CI + PR template | `.github/` |
| Forbidden patterns | `golangci-lint` custom rules | `.golangci.yml` |
| TODO discipline | CI regex check | `scripts/ci/check-todo-tracking.sh` |
| Deprecation policy | CI scan on `Deprecated:` | `scripts/ci/check-deprecations.sh` |
| Dependency minimalism | `go mod tidy` + `govulncheck` | `security.yml` |
| Feature flag hygiene | CI scan of flag registry | `scripts/ci/check-flag-age.sh` |
| SLOs as code | `internal/obs/slo.go` struct + Prometheus derivation | `docker/prometheus/` |
| Runbook ↔ alert link | CI bidirectional check | `scripts/ci/check-runbook-links.sh` |
| Doc freshness | CI scan | `scripts/ci/check-doc-freshness.sh` |
| Doc-code citation validity | CI scan | `scripts/ci/check-doc-code-links.sh` |
| Never two sources of truth | Generated-file regen on release | `release.yml` |
| Generated-file banner | CI scan for banner | `scripts/ci/check-generated-banner.sh` |
| Agent orientation | `CLAUDE.md` + `doc.go` per package | convention + CI |
| Structured log fields | Grep-based check in CI | `scripts/ci/check-log-fields.sh` |

If a mechanism doesn't exist, it's a gap to be filled — we don't
rely on reviewer vigilance alone for anything in this table.

## 7. When standards conflict with velocity

Real-world scenarios:

### Scenario A: we found a production bug

- Hotfix is small: normal PR, expedited review, normal CI. No
  bypass.
- Hotfix must be large: engage tech lead, split into minimum-viable-fix
  + follow-up cleanup PRs. Still CI, still review.
- Never a "ship and fix standards later" — fix later never comes.

### Scenario B: a feature is needed for a demo in 2 days

- Unless the feature has a standards-violating shortcut that's
  faster, we don't skip standards.
- If the shortcut saves > 1 day AND the tech lead agrees AND the
  debt is tracked as a `P0 cleanup` issue with scheduled
  resolution within 2 weeks: documented exception in PR
  description. Shipped.
- If any of the three conditions fails: do the standards-compliant
  version, adjust scope or demo date.

### Scenario C: an external dep's API changes on short notice

- Pin the old version, add workaround with tracked removal (§2.7).
- If the old version is vulnerable: upgrade with workaround + track
  the cleanup.
- Never carry workarounds silently.

### Scenario D: someone merges a standards violation

- Not a blame event — standards slip because enforcement had a
  gap. Add the enforcement gap to the backlog.
- Violation gets a follow-up PR within the same sprint; tech lead
  pairs with author on the fix.

**Escalation path:** violations that happen > 2× in a month
trigger a root-cause discussion at the monthly retro. If the
standard is the problem (too burdensome, too vague), change the
standard via this doc's amendment process.

---

## 8. Amending this doc

- Every change to `engineering-standards.md` is a PR with the tech
  lead as approver.
- Changes land only when the team agrees in writing in the PR.
- CHANGELOG entry under `[Unreleased]` → `### Changed` documents
  the standard change.
- Standards that are relaxed have a rationale in the PR body
  (never "we got lazy").

This is itself a **living document**. It drifts if we let it.
Quarterly doc-hygiene sweep touches this file too.

---

## 9. Periodic reviews

### 9.1. Weekly (15 min, Friday)

- Run `scripts/ci/check-doc-freshness.sh` locally; note anything
  approaching 90-day stale.
- Skim the flag registry for expired flags.
- Review any `P0 cleanup` issues opened during the week.

### 9.2. Monthly (1 h, first Monday)

- Retrospective: any standards violations this month? Root cause?
- Review the runbook set: any alerts without runbooks?
- Review the dependency graph: any new deps without ADRs?

### 9.3. Quarterly (1 day, end of quarter)

- Full doc-hygiene sweep.
- Full vendor review.
- Full dependency audit.
- Full ADR review: any superseded without explicit linkage?
- `engineering-standards.md` review: still right?

### 9.4. Annually

- Full security audit (external).
- Full capacity review.
- Full licensing + redistribution review on data providers.

Each review has an output committed to
`docs/operations/reviews/<date>-<type>.md`.

## 11. Agent-specific onboarding shortcut

If you are an AI agent reading this file cold, the **fastest
orientation** to actual work is:

1. Read `CLAUDE.md` at repo root. (Not this file — that one.)
2. Run `make help` — list of targets.
3. Look at `docs/architecture/overview.md` + the most recent ADR.
4. Identify the package you'll modify; read its `doc.go` first.
5. `git log -p --since='3 months'` on that package to see recent
   patterns.
6. Write the smallest possible PR. Consult this doc only when
   uncertain.

This doc (`engineering-standards.md`) is the **policy**. `CLAUDE.md`
is the **map**. Use the map first; consult the policy when the
map isn't enough.

## 12. What this doc deliberately doesn't decide

- **Language-specific style** beyond what's listed here — we lean
  on `gofumpt`, `goimports -local`, and `golangci-lint`; their
  rules are the style.
- **Code of conduct** beyond the Contributor Covenant in
  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
- **Hiring standards** — those live in hiring docs.
- **Compensation / equity / legal** — not engineering policy.

Anything not in this doc is not a standard. If something should
be a standard, open a PR amending this file.

  mechanism; complements this doc's aspirational standards.
