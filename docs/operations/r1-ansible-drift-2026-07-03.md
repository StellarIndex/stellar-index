# r1 ↔ ansible drift audit (2026-07-03)

**Trigger:** the 2026-06-11 incident's rsyslog suppression rules turned
out to be codified in ansible but **never applied to r1** (the
postmortem recorded codified-as-applied). That raised the reverse
question: what lives on r1 by hand that ansible would **erase** if the
playbook ran? Both directions were audited: every `dest:` in
`configs/ansible/roles/*/tasks` plus the r1 overlay surfaces
(prometheus, alertmanager, caddy, systemd units) diffed against the
live host.

## ⚠️ Standing rule

**RESOLVED 2026-07-03 (same day):** after 18 dry-run rounds + staged
application, the full playbook applies cleanly to live r1 (exit 0,
failed=0) and IS now the deployment path for host config. Guardrails:
the hourly `config-assertions.sh` timer, the weekly `ansible-drift.yml`
workflow (fails on >allowance changed tasks), and the CI ansible
syntax/lint job. Always `--check --diff` before an apply; binaries stay
with deploy.yml (`manage_stellarindex_binaries=false`).

Post-mortem-grade findings from the APPLY stages (beyond the table
below): the role would have downgraded the live upstream OpenZFS 2.3.4
to Ubuntu's 2.2.2 — apt deleted the dkms module before failing,
leaving the pool one reboot from gone (recovered from the 2026-05-21
migration debs; packages now held + role gated + 3 new assertions);
galexie ran on MinIO ROOT creds and now uses the dedicated
galexie-writer user; the vault's galexie keys had been literal
placeholder braces since April; postgres's hand-tuned 8GB
max_wal_size was inert behind a postgresql.auto.conf override the
whole time (auto.conf RESET; the file is single-source now).

## Findings — live-on-r1, absent-from-ansible (would be ERASED)

| # | Surface | Live state | Codified? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | `[supply]` in `/etc/stellarindex.toml` | 16 `sdf_reserve_accounts` + `reserve_balances_stroops` table (CS-010 fix, 2026-07-02) | ✅ 2026-07-03: template renders the balances table; accounts + balances now in `inventory/r1.yml` vars |
| 2 | Redis `maxmemory 1gb` (2026-06-16 sweep) | Debian-packaged redis, hand-edited conf; the redis-sentinel role is the future HA shape and does NOT manage it | ✅ 2026-07-03: archival-node lineinfile task |
| 3 | nftables nft-drop log tweak (`5/second … level info`, 2026-06-30) + `10-nft-drop.conf` rsyslog + logrotate pair | Hand observability addition | ✅ 2026-07-03: template matches live (5/s level info) + rsyslog/logrotate pair in 15-log-discipline |
| 4 | nftables `11625 accept` (F-1201, future validator) | Hand rule; template gates it on `run_stellar_core`, which is `false` in r1.yml | ✅ resolved by decision: the rule dropped at apply (nothing listens; run_stellar_core flips it back for Phase 3) |
| 5 | Caddy (public TLS edge) | Entirely hand-managed; live still bound a legacy-domain alias the repo Caddyfile had dropped | ✅ 2026-07-03: 19-caddy.yml (official repo form, Caddyfile.j2, caddy validate); legacy-domain alias removed same day in the brand purge |
| 6 | systemd units (`stellarindex-*.service`) | Live = root-user shape; repo `deploy/systemd/` = non-root future shape (task #30) | ✅ 2026-07-03: the staged apply EXECUTED the non-root migration — all three services run as `stellarindex` |
| 7 | sshd | Live = stock Ubuntu (root-with-key); template needs `ssh_permit_root_login` | ✅ 2026-07-03: pinned `"prohibit-password"` in r1.yml (deploy workflow + agents SSH as root) |

## Findings — repo-ahead-of-r1 (apply-gaps, now closed)

- rsyslog loki/clickhouse suppression (2026-06-11 fix) — **applied
  2026-07-03**, probe-verified.
- Prometheus rules: `served_value_drift`/`_check_stale` (board #14),
  `divergence_no_reference` (CS-088), `ch_live_sink_drops`/`_sustained`
  (ADR-0041), plus rebrand wording in anomaly/api/sla-probe — **synced
  2026-07-03**. Live rules.r1 now matches the repo tree exactly.
- prometheus.yml / alertmanager.yml: live is older but strictly a
  subset (no live-only material lines). Alertmanager sync is gated on
  the Discord/Healthchecks env vars existing (operator account item).

## False positives worth remembering

Raw-text diffs against `.j2` templates flag loop/var-rendered content
as "missing" — the nftables 80/443/SSH-limit rules ARE in the role
(`public_allow_ports_base` defaults) despite not appearing in the
template text. Render (`ansible-playbook --check --diff`) before
believing a template gap.

## 2026-07-06 reconcile — ZFS datasets + shared_preload false-drift (BACKLOG #50)

The weekly `ansible-drift.yml` was failing at `changed=14` (allowance 13).
A read-only `--check --diff` against live r1 broke the count down, and three
of the changed items were **phantom drift** (the codified value could never
equal what the module reads back), now fixed:

- **`Create ZFS datasets` (8 item-diffs → 1 changed task).** The
  `community.general.zfs` module reads current props with `zfs get -p`
  (parsable), so a human-readable `recordsize: "128K"` never equals the live
  `131072` and every run re-reported a change. `zfs_datasets` recordsize
  values are now the byte form (`131072`/`8192`/`1048576`), grounded in
  `zfs get -p` on r1.
- **`Add timescaledb to shared_preload_libraries` (+ its `Restart postgres`
  handler = 2 changed items).** `postgresql_set` string-compares the desired
  value against the live `pg_settings` value, which Postgres stores with a
  space (`timescaledb, pg_stat_statements`). The spaceless codified value
  drifted every run; now matches the stored form.

Same pass **closed BACKLOG #50**: the out-of-band `data/pgbackrest` and
`data/restore-drill` datasets are now codified. Both set only `mountpoint`
locally on r1 (the rest inherit the pool defaults), so the
`Create ZFS datasets` task was made **item-driven** — it manages exactly the
properties each entry declares, rather than forcing all six with defaults.
Forcing an inherited/default-source property would have re-reported a change
on every run. `pgbackrest`'s mount dir carries `dir_mode: "0750"` (postgres
backup repo) via the new per-item `dir_mode` knob.

Post-fix the verified recap is `changed=11` (≤ 13). The remaining 11 are all
either **repo-ahead-of-r1** (clear on the next apply — `Install r1-smoke.sh`
+ its smoke-timer handler, `Install config-assertions script`, `heavy-job
wrapper`, the three `Ownership — … data dir` 0755→0750 hardenings) or
**inherently non-idempotent** (`Sync migrations` rsync mtime/owner itemize
from a fresh checkout; `disable-thp` oneshot `state: started`; the
catchup-probe/`Ensure migrations dir` metadata) — i.e. exactly what the
allowance exists for. The allowance was left at 13.

## The durable fix

Make ansible the actual deployment path for r1 (run with
`--check --diff`, reconcile the table above, then apply for real and
keep applying). Until then: every hand fix on r1 gets codified in the
same PR (this audit is the enforcement backstop), and
`config-assertions.sh` alerts on regressions of the load-bearing
subset.
