# Operator-action register (audit remediation 2026-07)

Everything the two audits (correctness/security 2026-06-30 + maintainability
2026-07-01) surfaced that an agent **cannot** safely do alone — because it needs a
GitHub/cloud/vendor account, a secret, a legal decision, prod infra, or a
judgment call that's yours. The code-side fixes are being applied separately;
these wait for you.

## Repo / CI settings (highest leverage — one setting unlocks every guard)
- [x] **Branch-protect `main` + require status checks** (CS-097) — DONE 2026-07-02
  via two repo rulesets: `main-integrity` (force-push + deletion blocked for
  everyone, no bypass) and `main-required-checks` (the 12 core CI jobs are
  required status checks; **repository admins bypass** so the live-in-development
  direct-push workflow keeps working — the push-triggered CI run on main remains
  the tripwire for that path). CS-098's self-editable-allowlist bypass is closed
  by `scripts/ci/lint-baseline-growth.sh` (baselines are shrink-only; growth
  needs an explicit `Baseline-Growth:` commit trailer). **Optional tightening
  left to you:** remove the admin bypass when the team is >1 / post-launch, and
  enable Dependabot security alerts if not already on.

## Accounts / secrets (launch-blocking, operator-only)
- [ ] **Buy CoinGecko Pro** → set `COINGECKO_API_KEY` on r1 + restart indexer (P0-3).
- [ ] **Create Healthchecks.io account + Discord webhooks** → paste `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL_PAGES`/
  `_ALERTS` + the 4× `HEALTHCHECKS_URL_*` into r1 env files; rerun `pre-launch-check.sh`.
- [ ] **Rotate the postgres_exporter DSN password** (leaked in earlier session output;
  in `/etc/default/prometheus-postgres-exporter`).
- [ ] **Relocate + rotate the GCP service-account key** (CS-001) — `rates-engine-data-
  validation-*.json` sits in the repo working tree (gitignored, not committed). Move it
  out of the repo dir; rotate if it was ever shared; confirm the SA is still used.

## Set config values (code is ready; values are yours)
- [x] **`sdf_reserve_accounts` — DONE 2026-07-02 (agent, with evidence).** The 16
  accounts from SDF's own dashboard source (stellar/dashboard common/lumens.js:
  escrows, direct development, growth, product+innovation, assets+liquidity,
  network upgrade reserve) + lake-read balances; the sum matches SDF's published
  mandate+upgradeReserve to 4e-13. Live result: served circulating 33.99B vs
  SDF 33.98B (rel_err 0.0003 — the residual is the protocol fee pool, ~0.03%,
  not an account). verify-served-values pins it green continuously.
- [ ] **Re-raise `min_usd_volume` to the 10000 default** once CEX/CoinGecko data flows
  (currently 0 to serve on-chain-only micro-volume; CS-040 makes the gate scale-correct).

## r1 migration to non-root services (CS-118/CS-119) — ordered, no-surprise
The Ansible role now creates the `stellarindex` system user (04-users.yml) and
runs the app daemons + timer oneshots as `User=stellarindex` (hardened units
ported from `deploy/systemd/`). Applying `--tags users,minio,observability,stellarindex`
to r1 does most of this, but the RUNNING host needs the ownership flips done in
order so nothing restarts onto files it can't read. By hand (or verify the role
did each step):

1. **Create the user/group** (idempotent):
   `useradd --system --shell /usr/sbin/nologin --home-dir /var/lib/stellarindex --no-create-home stellarindex || true`
2. **Stop the daemons** (timer oneshots: just confirm none is mid-run via
   `systemctl list-units 'stellarindex-*' '*completeness*' 'ch-supply*' 'sep1-*' 'data-freshness*' 'supply-snapshot*' 'verify-archive-*'`):
   `systemctl stop stellarindex-api stellarindex-aggregator stellarindex-indexer`
3. **Chown state + env files** (binaries in `/usr/local/bin` STAY root:root 0755 —
   world-exec, root-owned is correct for non-root services):
   - `chown -R stellarindex:stellarindex /var/lib/stellarindex`
   - `chown -R stellarindex:stellarindex /var/lib/node_exporter/textfile_collector`
   - `chgrp stellarindex /etc/default/stellarindex /etc/default/stellarindex-ops && chmod 0640 /etc/default/stellarindex /etc/default/stellarindex-ops`
4. **Install the new unit files** (ansible `--tags stellarindex`, or copy the
   rendered units) then `systemctl daemon-reload`.
5. **Start + verify**:
   `systemctl start stellarindex-indexer stellarindex-aggregator stellarindex-api`,
   confirm `ps -o user= -p $(systemctl show -p MainPID --value stellarindex-api)`
   says `stellarindex` (per unit), then `bash scripts/dev/r1-smoke.sh`.
6. **Rollback** if anything misbehaves: reinstall the previous unit files
   (root ones), `daemon-reload`, start — the chowns are backwards-compatible
   (root reads everything).

Note: `archive-completeness.service` intentionally stays `User=root` for now —
its `ExecStartPre` writes `/run/archive-completeness.env` and its report lands
in the galexie-owned `/var/lib/galexie`; follow-up is `RuntimeDirectory=` +
report relocation (see the unit template comment).

## Classic supply under-read (found 2026-07-02 by verify-served-values)
The trustline/claimable/LP observers matched their watched set in
CODE:ISSUER form while the config (correctly, per its docs) supplies
CODE-ISSUER — so all three observed NOTHING since they shipped and every
classic asset's served supply degraded to its SAC-held slice (USDC read
40M vs ~266M; lake supply_flows cross-check: net SAC flows 272.9M vs
Stellar Expert 265.9M, i.e. the lake is right and the served tier was
missing the classic trustline component entirely). Code fix landed
(supply.CanonicalizeWatchedClassic); your half, in order:
- [x] Deploy — DONE 2026-07-02 (v0.7.0): all five observers wired; trustlines
  observed 6,260 events in the first 45 seconds.
- [x] **Historical state seed — DONE 2026-07-03 (agent).** Full checkpoint
  state-snapshot (48M entries) into the lake, then 2.69M trustline rows
  seeded into `trustline_observations` for the 8 watched assets from
  `ledger_entries_current FINAL`.
- [x] **verify-served-values: ALL GREEN 2026-07-03** — xlm_total 4e-7,
  xlm_circulating 3e-4, usdc_total 1.3e-3 (served 272.84M vs SE 272.49M).

## Disaster recovery (CS-110/111/112 — design + tooling shipped, ADR-0043; your half:)
- [ ] **Provision the offsite bucket for `repo2`** (Hetzner Storage Box or Backblaze B2,
  ~1.1 TB for 4 fulls at today's 273 GB compressed) → set the `pgbackrest_repo2_*`
  vars + cipher pass in vault, flip `pgbackrest_manage_conf: true` after reviewing
  the rendered `pgbackrest.conf` diff, run `stanza-upgrade` + a first full to repo2.
- [ ] **Run `scripts/ops/restore-drill.sh` by hand twice** (once `DRILL_REPO=1`, once
  `=2` when repo2 exists; add `DRILL_CH_WINDOW=100000` on one run to measure the CH
  re-derive RTO). Commit the appended `docs/operations/drills/restore-drills.md`
  entries; then we wire the monthly timer.
- [ ] **CH lake tail + DDL offsite push** (ADR-0043 §2.1/2.3) — script rides with the
  repo2 provisioning (same bucket); the full-CH-backup decision waits on the drill's
  measured re-derive throughput, deliberately.

## Multi-region / HA (gated on hosts existing — P3)
- [ ] Provision R2 (AWS) + R3 (Vultr); then the `redis-sentinel`/patroni/bringup roles run.
- [ ] **Patroni REST auth** (CS-122) — set `patroni_rest_basic_auth_user/password` in vault
  before Patroni deploys. The role now FAILS the play if they're empty and listens on
  the private interface (`ansible_host`), not 0.0.0.0 — so the only operator action
  left is choosing the credentials.
- [ ] Narrow `allowed_ssh_cidrs` from `0.0.0.0/0` once a stable admin range exists.
- [ ] Optional: Cloudflare orange-cloud in front of `api.` (WAF/L7).

## Decoder contract-gating (CS-026) — blocked on per-source data/design
The mechanism exists (`childgate.Registry` seeded from the `protocol_contracts`
table + hard-coded factories, gated `Matches()` — as `blend`/`soroswap` already
do). Extending it to the 4 ungated sources is blocked on data only the team /
operator can supply — a gate on an UNCONFIRMED factory either drops real trades
(fail-closed, unseeded) or bakes in a wrong trust root, so it must not be guessed:
- [x] **phoenix** — GATED code-side 2026-07-02 (curated-set registry: the
      page's 11 pools + 3 stake contracts are the in-code seed; the factory's
      creation events predate the lake so the seed is the trust root). Your
      half per ADR-0040 §2: deploy → lake re-derive (`projector-replay
      -source phoenix -from 51572016`; foreign-emitter rows, if any existed,
      surface as per-ledger projection mismatches) → one green
      `compute-completeness -ch -source phoenix` cycle. Team confirmation of
      the pool list is now ratification, not a blocker.
- [ ] **defindex** — RE-BLOCKED with evidence 2026-07-02: lake emitters grew
      to 88 vaults + 22 strategies vs the 57 verified on 2026-06-12, and the
      `create` event does NOT carry the vault address (the page's open
      question), so the growth cannot be deploy-graph-verified. Gating on raw
      emitter lists would bake look-alikes into the trust root. Path: the
      ADR-0040 §3 enumeration (creation-op chain + wasm-hash cross-check),
      or the team answers the page's open question (factory view /
      authoritative list).
- [x] **cctp `mint_and_forward` catch-up — DONE 2026-07-03 (agent).** The
      rollout found TWO more gating layers (migration 0038's SQL CHECK +
      the storage enum) → migration 0070 + v0.7.1 patch release + replay;
      1,577 historical rows persisted, all five event types live.
- [ ] **aquarius** — pin the complete pool set (docs/protocols/aquarius.md: "pool
      enumeration not yet pinned"). Until enumerated, no gate is possible.
- [ ] **comet** — has NO factory namespace (shared `("POOL",…)` topic). Decide the
      gate design: a curated pool allowlist OR a WASM-hash gate (only decode
      contracts whose code-hash matches the Balancer-v1 Comet WASM). Needs the
      WASM hash + a design call.
Once each source's factory/allowlist is confirmed, wiring the gate is a small
mechanical change per source (add to `gatedSources`, make the decoder
childgate-aware, gate `Matches()` on `reg.Has(contractID)`).

## Legal / vendor (before commercial launch — CS-115/116)
- [ ] **Vendor-ToS review of raw CEX data redistribution** — `/v1/history` + `/v1/observations?
  source=binance` re-serve raw per-trade source-attributed records; Binance/Kraken/Coinbase
  terms generally prohibit this. Blended outputs (`/v1/price|vwap|…`) are defensible. Decide
  whether to gate raw source-attributed endpoints for restricted venues.
- [ ] **External security review** booking (P2-3).
- [ ] Confirm CoinGecko Pro redistribution terms; add a `NOTICE`/`THIRD_PARTY` file + the
  goxdr dual-license (GPL/Apache→Apache elected) note for the pre-flip SBOM gate.

## Launch cutover (operator/DNS — P2-5/P2-6)
- [ ] DNS flip finalization, public rate-limit tier, announcement, 24h watch (endpoints are
  already DNS+TLS live; this is the go-live decision + comms).
