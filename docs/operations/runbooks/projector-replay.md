# Runbook — `projector-replay` (operator subcommand)

## At a glance

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Trigger | Per-source projection is stale or missing rows for a known ledger range (e.g. post-decoder-fix re-walk). |
| Tool | `stellarindex-ops projector-replay -source <name> -from <ledger>` |
| Typical wall time | ≤ 5 s SQL + projector catch-up (≈ 1 min per 100k ledgers per source) |
| Impact | None — the projector tails `soroban_events` (ADR-0029); replay just rewinds a cursor. `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` makes re-writes idempotent. |

## Before you start: is this the right tool?

`projector-replay` is bound by the live projector's own tick cadence
(5s `Interval`) and 60s `PerSourceTimeout` per cycle — roughly a
720k-ledger/hour ceiling. For a rewind bigger than about **1M
ledgers**, use **`stellarindex-ops projected-rebuild`** instead
(ADR-0048 D3) — parallel workers, no per-cycle deadline, 10-20x the
throughput, same decoders + same idempotent writes. See
[docs/architecture/ingest-pipeline.md](../../architecture/ingest-pipeline.md#binding-rules)'s
"Projected-source catch-up" section for the full comparison, and
`internal/ops/chops/projected_rebuild.go`'s doc comment for the
one-writer contract between the two tools (they must never run
concurrently against overlapping history for the same source).

## Why this exists

ADR-0032 Phase 5 (rc.97) **deleted** the family of `*-backfill`
operator subcommands (`cctp-backfill`, `rozo-backfill`,
`soroswap-skim-backfill`, `comet-liquidity-backfill`,
`phoenix-backfill`, `blend-backfill`, `sep41-transfers-backfill`,
`drain-cascade-window`). They no longer exist. `projector-replay`
is the primary catch-up path for SMALL projected-source rewinds
(bigger ones use `projected-rebuild` — see above) — one
cursor-rewind:

```sh
stellarindex-ops projector-replay -config /etc/stellarindex.toml \
  -source <name> -from <ledger>
```

The projector goroutine in `stellarindex-indexer` is already
tailing `soroban_events`; rewinding the per-source cursor makes it
re-project the requested window on its next cycle (≤ 5 s
projector interval). Per-source tables use ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING
so re-writes are idempotent.

## Quick diagnosis (≤ 5 min)

```sh
# 1. Where is the projector's per-source cursor right now?
ssh root@136.243.90.96 'psql -U stellarindex -d stellarindex -c \
  "SELECT source, sub_source, last_ledger, last_updated FROM ingestion_cursors \
   WHERE source = '"'"'projector'"'"' ORDER BY sub_source"'

# 2. What rows are actually present in the per-source table for
#    the range you want to backfill?
ssh root@136.243.90.96 'psql -U stellarindex -d stellarindex -c \
  "SELECT MIN(ledger), MAX(ledger), COUNT(*) FROM trades \
   WHERE source = '"'"'aquarius'"'"' AND ledger BETWEEN 62000000 AND 62100000"'

# 3. What rows are present in soroban_events for that range +
#    the per-source's topic? If there are events but no rows in
#    the per-source table, replay will populate. If no events,
#    nothing to do.
ssh root@136.243.90.96 'psql -U stellarindex -d stellarindex -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM soroban_events \
   WHERE ledger BETWEEN 62000000 AND 62100000 AND topic_0_sym = '"'"'swap'"'"'"'
```

## Replay procedure

```sh
# Dry-run first to see what would happen.
stellarindex-ops projector-replay -config /etc/stellarindex.toml \
  -source aquarius -from 62000000 -dry-run

# Live.
stellarindex-ops projector-replay -config /etc/stellarindex.toml \
  -source aquarius -from 62000000
```

Source names match the projector registry
(`internal/projector/registry.go`):
`aquarius`, `soroswap`, `phoenix`, `comet`, `blend`, `cctp`, `rozo`,
`defindex`, `soroswap-skim`, `sep41-transfers`, `sep41-supply`,
`reflector-dex`, `reflector-cex`, `reflector-fx`, `redstone`.

## Verification

After replay, the projector cycle log lines (one per minute when
catching up) show progress:

```sh
ssh root@136.243.90.96 'journalctl -u stellarindex-indexer -n 100 -f | grep projector'
```

`projector_lag_ledgers{source="<name>"}` falls to 0 once the
replay is caught up to the live tip.

## Known false-positive patterns

- Asking the projector to replay a range earlier than the source's
  Soroban-genesis is a no-op — there are no events to project.
  Cursor still rewinds but the next cycle scans an empty range
  and advances back to the same toLedger.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-10 — ADR-0048 D3: added `projected-rebuild` as the
  catch-up path for rewinds beyond ~1M ledgers; this runbook now
  covers only the small-rewind case.
- 2026-06-12 — F-1330: fix diagnosis SQL (`ingestion_cursors` not
  `source_cursors`; `last_updated` not `updated_at`); normalise flag
  form to single-dash to match the binary.
- 2026-05-29 — initial draft (ADR-0032 Phase 5 rc.97).
