# FX history empty / `fx_quotes` table missing

## At a glance

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Trigger | Customer report: "FX history is empty" / operator-noticed `history_1y: 0` on `/v1/assets/<fiat>`. No specific Prometheus alert fires today — surfaces as a recurring WARN in the API log. |
| Severity | P3 (data-quality, not data-loss) |
| Detected by | API log: `forex: fx_quotes persist failed ... pq: relation "fx_quotes" does not exist` |
| Typical MTTR | 5–15 min (one-shot operator action: apply migration + restart) |
| Impact | FX history endpoints serve `history_1y: 0` and `history_all: 0` for every ticker. `history_7d` populates normally because it reads from a different surface. The aggregator's stablecoin-fiat proxy is unaffected (uses `[trades].usd_pegged_classic_assets`, not `fx_quotes`). |

Companion to [`db-disk-full.md`](db-disk-full.md) and
[`redis-write-blocked-disk-full.md`](redis-write-blocked-disk-full.md).
Different shape: a database migration that ships in the repo
(0028) but hasn't been applied to the deployment, so a feature
that depends on the new table fails silently at runtime.

This runbook captures the 2026-05-10 finding on r1 + the recovery
sequence so future operators don't re-investigate from
"FX history is empty for EUR" backwards. (Original 2026-05-10
investigation was against `/v1/currencies/EUR`, retired in
rc.48 — same data now flows through `/v1/assets/eur`; the
underlying `fx_quotes` table is the same and the runbook below
applies unchanged.)

## Signal

- `/v1/assets/eur` (or any other fiat ticker) returns
  `history_1y: 0` and `history_all: 0` on the wire while
  `history_7d` populates normally.
- API log shows recurring WARN every forex refresh tick:
  ```
  {"level":"WARN","msg":"forex: fx_quotes persist failed",
   "rows":810,
   "err":"timescale: InsertFXQuoteBatch ticker=\"AED\":
          pq: relation \"fx_quotes\" does not exist
          at position 2:15 (42P01)"}
  ```
- `psql -tA -c "SELECT to_regclass('public.fx_quotes')"` returns
  empty.
- `psql -tA -c "SELECT version FROM schema_migrations
  ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1"` returns 27 (or older).

## Why this happens

The `fx_quotes` hypertable was added in PR #1041 (task #104,
"Persistent fx_quotes hypertable + 10y backfill") via migration
0028. The migration ships in the repo at
`migrations/0028_create_fx_quotes.up.sql`. Two operator-side
steps make it live on a deployment:

1. **Copy the migration file** to the deployment's migrations
   directory (`/var/lib/ratesengine/migrations/` on r1).
2. **Apply it** via `ratesengine-migrate up`.

Once the table exists, the forex worker (running inside
`ratesengine-api`) starts persisting on its next refresh tick,
so live data backfills forward as it arrives. Historical depth
needs the one-shot `fx-history-backfill` script — see step 3.

## Triage (1 min)

```sh
# 1. Confirm the table is missing
sudo -u postgres psql -d ratesengine -tA -c "SELECT to_regclass('public.fx_quotes')"
# → empty line means missing

# 2. Confirm migration version
sudo -u postgres psql -d ratesengine -tA -c "SELECT version, dirty FROM schema_migrations ORDER BY version DESC LIMIT 1"
# → 27|f means migration 0028 hasn't been applied yet

# 3. Confirm the API log shows the symptom (every ~5 min)
journalctl -u ratesengine-api --since "10 minutes ago" -o cat | grep "fx_quotes persist failed" | tail -1
```

## Recovery (5 min)

### 1. Copy the migration file

From your local checkout:

```sh
scp migrations/0028_create_fx_quotes.{up,down}.sql \
    root@<host>:/var/lib/ratesengine/migrations/
```

(R1 host: `136.243.90.96`. The `migrations/` directory is the
authoritative path the `ratesengine-migrate` binary reads —
confirm with `cat /etc/systemd/system/ratesengine-migrate*.service`
if you've moved it.)

### 2. Apply the migration

```sh
ssh root@<host> '
  set -e
  cd /var/lib/ratesengine
  /usr/local/bin/ratesengine-migrate \
    -migrations migrations \
    -dsn "$RATESENGINE_POSTGRES_DSN" \
    up
'
```

Expected output: `1/u create_fx_quotes` then exit 0.

The migration is forward-only, additive, and idempotent on
re-runs (the `create_hypertable` call uses `if_not_exists =>
TRUE`; the table itself doesn't but won't be re-attempted because
`schema_migrations.version` advances). Safe to apply on a live
deployment — no service restart needed; the forex worker picks
up the new table on its next refresh tick.

### 3. Confirm the worker started persisting

```sh
journalctl -u ratesengine-api --since "5 minutes ago" -o cat \
  | grep -c "fx_quotes persist failed"
# → 0 once the next refresh tick fires (≈5 min cadence)

sudo -u postgres psql -d ratesengine -tA -c "SELECT count(*) FROM fx_quotes"
# → > 0 within ~5 min
```

### 4. Backfill historical depth (slow path — separate step)

The forward-flow worker only writes the LATEST snapshot per
refresh tick — it doesn't go back in time. The 1y / all-time
fiat charts need historical data that the one-shot
`fx-history-backfill` binary fetches from the ECB-backed
Frankfurter API (frankfurter.dev) — free, no API key, ~32
currencies, daily granularity back to 1999-01-04.

```sh
# On the operator's workstation:
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://...:5432/ratesengine
go run ./scripts/ops/fx-history-backfill --years=25
```

No cost — Frankfurter is free (ECB reference rates,
maintained as a public utility). The script walks the window in
5-year chunks (one HTTP request per chunk) so a 25-year backfill
is ~6 requests total. Safe to interrupt and resume — the writer
upserts on `(ticker, bucket)` so re-running on the same range
is a no-op.

The script logs one line per chunk to stderr; on completion it
writes a final summary (total chunks, total rows, elapsed).

## Prevention

The 2026-05-10 finding exposed a process gap: a release that
adds a migration ships the binary changes via the deploy
workflow, but the migration files + `ratesengine-migrate up`
are operator-side actions not automated by the same workflow.
Two paths forward (pick one):

1. **Wire migrations into the deploy workflow** — add a
   `migrate-up` step to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` that runs
   before the binary swap. Adds a per-deployment cost (one
   pg-connection round trip + the actual migration time) but
   eliminates the manual step entirely.
2. **Add a startup gate** — `ratesengine-api`'s ready check
   compares the binary's expected schema version (computed at
   build time from the embedded migrations) against
   `schema_migrations.version`; readyz returns 503 with a
   diagnostic if they diverge. Doesn't auto-apply but prevents
   the silent runtime failure.

Either would surface this class of gap immediately at deploy
time rather than letting it silently fail at runtime. Tracking
as follow-up to this runbook.
