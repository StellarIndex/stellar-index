# Runbook — `stellarindex_dex_nonstandard_decimals_detected`

## Why this exists

The served price is `Σ(quote_amount) / Σ(base_amount)` computed on **raw
smallest-unit integers** — both in the `prices_*` continuous aggregates
(`migrations/0002_create_price_aggregates.up.sql`) and in `aggregate.VWAP`
(`internal/aggregate/vwap.go`). The per-asset decimals **cancel in that
ratio only when the base and quote assets share the same decimals scale.**

Every DEX-traded Stellar token to date is 7-decimal (SACs are always 7;
classic credits are uniformly 7; the pure-SEP-41 tokens observed all declare
`decimals = 7`), so the ratio equals the true price and the served value is
correct. The decoders are correct too — they store faithful native-decimal
amounts (ADR-0003); the gap is purely the *absence* of a decimals
normalization on the read side.

The latent risk: the first non-7-decimal SEP-41 token to gain DEX liquidity
(an 18-decimal bridged asset, a 6-dp token, …) makes **every served price
for a pair involving it silently skew by `10^(7−decimals)`**, with no other
alarm. `internal/decimalsguard` sweeps recently-DEX-traded Soroban tokens,
resolves each one's on-chain `decimals()` from the certified lake, and raises
`stellarindex_dex_trade_nonstandard_decimals_total{source,asset}` the moment
one is confirmed `!= 7`. This alert turns that silent landmine into a loud
signal so the mispricing is caught **before** a customer consumes it.

**This stopped being latent on 2026-07-08.** Token
`CC2RBGYNCFBCVENIDL5BFBWPH4OUZM2UA3OD2K2N54GLMWCC4KWPVAGO` declares
`decimals()=9` and traded on aquarius against USDC; the served price was
exactly 100x wrong (`41.32` vs true `~4132`) for 35 trades since
2026-06-22 before the guard confirmed it. That confirmed incident is why
this runbook now has a real stop-serving lever (2026-07-09) instead of
only a detector — see "Mitigation" below.

## At a glance

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Alert | `stellarindex_dex_nonstandard_decimals_detected` |
| Severity | P2 |
| Detected by | Prometheus rule in `deploy/monitoring/rules/aggregator.yml` (and `configs/prometheus/rules.r1/aggregator.yml`) |
| Typical MTTR | Automatic within ~60s of confirmation (the API-side serving guard); the full normalization remains a scheduled code change + deploy |
| Impact | A **real, live pair** has a leg with confirmed non-7 `decimals()`. As of 2026-07-09, `/v1/price`, `/v1/vwap`, `/v1/history`, `/v1/ohlc` DECLINE (422) any pair involving `{asset}` instead of serving the skewed value — see "Mitigation". Before that date (and for any deployment that hasn't run migration 0093 / doesn't wire `NonstandardDecimals`), those endpoints served the wrong price with no warning. |

## Symptoms

- The alert names a `source` (DEX connector) and `asset` (Soroban C-strkey
  contract id).
- The aggregator log (component `decimals-guard`) has an ERROR line with the
  exact `decimals` value and `price_skew_decades` (`|7 − decimals|`).
- The counter latches: once a token is detected it stays firing for the
  process lifetime (dedup is per `source`+`asset`).

## Quick diagnosis (≤ 5 min)

```sh
# 1. What decimals does the offending token declare? (the guard already
#    logged it; confirm from the lake directly)
journalctl -u stellarindex-aggregator | grep decimals-guard | tail

# 2. Which pairs are affected — every served pair with {asset} on either leg:
psql "$PG" -c "SELECT DISTINCT base_asset, quote_asset, source
               FROM trades
               WHERE (base_asset = '<asset>' OR quote_asset = '<asset>')
                 AND ts >= now() - interval '24 hours';"

# 3. How wrong is the served price? For a pair with a 7-dp counter-leg:
#    served = true_price * 10^(7 - decimals) when {asset} is the BASE leg,
#    served = true_price * 10^(decimals - 7) when {asset} is the QUOTE leg.
#    e.g. an 18-dp base token → served is 10^-11 of the true price.
```

If the token genuinely declares `decimals != 7`, this is a **true positive** —
the served price for those pairs is wrong. Proceed to mitigation.

## Mitigation (≤ 15 min)

Immediate (stop serving the wrong number) — **now mostly automatic**:

- [ ] **Nothing to do by default.** The moment `internal/decimalsguard`
      confirms the offender, it upserts `nonstandard_decimals_assets`
      (migration 0093) via `UpsertNonstandardDecimalsAsset`. The API's
      `NonstandardDecimalsCache` (`internal/api/v1`) refreshes that table
      every `NonstandardDecimalsRefreshInterval` (60s) and, from then on,
      `/v1/price`, `/v1/vwap`, `/v1/history`, `/v1/ohlc` DECLINE — `422
      problem+json`, `Cache-Control: no-store` — any pair with `{asset}` on
      either leg (`declineIfNonstandardDecimals` in
      `internal/api/v1/nonstandard_decimals_guard.go`). A declined price is
      honest; a wrong price is not.
- [ ] Verification: confirm the row exists —
      `psql "$PG" -c "SELECT * FROM nonstandard_decimals_assets WHERE asset = '<asset>';"`
      — and confirm the API is actually declining —
      `curl -s "$API_BASE_URL/v1/price?asset=<asset>&quote=fiat:USD" | jq .status`
      should show `422` within ~60s of the row appearing. If the row exists
      but the API still serves 200: check whether this deployment's
      `cmd/stellarindex-api` binary predates the guard, or whether
      `NonstandardDecimals` failed to wire (see "Known false-positive
      patterns" — a nil cache fails OPEN, i.e. serves normally).
- [ ] The alert stays latched (expected — it is a "this happened" signal,
      distinct from the API's live decline counter
      `stellarindex_price_serve_declined_nonstandard_decimals_total{asset}`,
      which tracks ongoing customer impact and tapers to zero once
      normalization ships).
- [ ] Manual fallback (guard not deployed yet, or the automatic path somehow
      didn't fire): `INSERT INTO nonstandard_decimals_assets (asset,
      decimals, source, confirmed_at) VALUES ('<asset>', <decimals>,
      '<source>', now());` — the API cache picks it up on its next refresh,
      no restart needed. This is the same row shape the guard writes; the
      table doesn't distinguish operator-inserted rows from guard-confirmed
      ones.

Durable (the real fix — schedule, do not hot-patch during the incident):

- [ ] Apply the **decimals normalization**: multiply the finalized ratio by
      `10^(dec_base − dec_quote)` at the read layer. See "Root cause analysis"
      for why this was deferred and what a correct fix must cover. Once
      normalization ships for `{asset}`, remove its row from
      `nonstandard_decimals_assets` (or simply stop re-confirming it) — the
      serving guard is self-clearing: the decline disappears within one
      cache refresh interval of the row going away.

## Root cause analysis

The forward normalization was deliberately **deferred** when this guard
shipped, because a *consistent* fix is not low-risk:

- There are **two** served-price paths that must agree: the materialized
  `prices_*` continuous aggregates (`/v1/history`, `/v1/ohlc`, the closed-1m
  point lookup behind `/v1/price`) and the query-time `aggregate.VWAP` path
  (`/v1/vwap`, `/v1/twap`, the aggregator's Redis-published VWAP).
- Normalizing only the `aggregate.VWAP` path is cheap (it recomputes from raw
  trades each call) but would make it **disagree** with the CAGG path for a
  non-7-dp token — trading one silent error for an inconsistency.
- Normalizing the CAGG path requires **rewriting a decade of materialized
  history** (the `prices_*` aggregates span back to 2015), which is not
  warranted for a latent risk and carries its own operational risk.

A correct fix therefore normalizes **both** read paths together, guarded so a
7-dp/7-dp pair (`10^0 = 1`) is byte-identical to today's behaviour and only
the non-7-dp case is scaled. Track this as the follow-up; this alert is the
forcing function that makes it real work rather than latent.

For the postmortem, gather: the offending contract id, its declared
`decimals()`, the list of affected pairs + their 24h volume, and how long the
skew was live before suppression.

## Known false-positive patterns

- **None expected.** The guard alarms only on a **confirmed** non-7
  `decimals()` (a successful lake read returning a value != 7). A resolution
  error or a token whose metadata isn't yet in the lake is treated as "cannot
  confirm" and never fires. If it fires, a token really does declare non-7
  decimals.
- A token could legitimately declare non-7 decimals and still be low-value /
  low-volume. Check step 2's volume before deciding urgency — but the served
  price is still wrong, so declining is correct regardless.
- **The API-side serving guard fails OPEN, never closed.** A nil
  `NonstandardDecimalsCache` (not wired in `cmd/stellarindex-api/main.go`), a
  cold cache (never refreshed yet), or a refresh error (Postgres blip —
  tracked by `stellarindex_nonstandard_decimals_cache_refresh_failures_total`,
  which retains the last-good snapshot rather than clearing it) all mean
  requests serve NORMALLY rather than declining. This is deliberate —
  availability wins over the guard for infra errors — but it means a
  confirmed offender can still serve briefly during an API-process restart
  before the initial cache refresh completes, or indefinitely on a
  deployment that predates migration 0093 / hasn't wired `NonstandardDecimals`.

## Changelog

- 2026-07-09 — added the READ-TIME enforcement half after a confirmed
  production incident (token `CC2RB…`, 100x-wrong price, 35 trades since
  2026-06-22): `/v1/price`, `/v1/vwap`, `/v1/history`, `/v1/ohlc` now
  DECLINE (422) rather than serve a price for a pair with a confirmed
  non-7-decimals leg. Migration 0093 (`nonstandard_decimals_assets`),
  `internal/decimalsguard` now upserts on confirmation,
  `internal/api/v1.NonstandardDecimalsCache` mirrors it API-side. Self-clearing
  once the durable normalization ships and the row is removed.
- 2026-07-07 — initial draft alongside the decimals-guard (decoder-correctness
  audit Finding 2).
