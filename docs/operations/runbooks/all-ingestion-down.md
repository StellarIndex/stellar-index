# Runbook — `ratesengine_ingestion_all_sources_stopped`

## At a glance

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Alert | `ratesengine_ingestion_all_sources_stopped` |
| Severity | **P1** (SEV-1) |
| Detected by | `sum(rate(ratesengine_source_events_total[5m]))` = 0 for > 3 min |
| Typical MTTR | 5–20 min depending on root cause |
| Impact | Price staleness begins at the 60 s cache TTL; API sets `stale_flag=true` globally. If the outage lasts > 30 min we breach the Freighter 30 s freshness SLA. |

## Symptoms

- Alert `ratesengine_ingestion_all_sources_stopped` fires.
- `ratesengine_api_price_stale` follows ~60 s later across every asset.
- Indexer logs show no activity, repeated MinIO read errors, or
  Galexie producing no fresh objects in `galexie-live`.

## Quick diagnosis (≤ 5 min)

The "all sources down" shape usually means one of three common roots: Galexie's MinIO output (the shared upstream), the shared storage (Timescale), or the indexer process itself.

```sh
# 1. Is the indexer running?
systemctl status ratesengine-indexer      # baremetal
# or
kubectl -n ratesengine get pod -l app=ratesengine-indexer

# 2. What do its logs say?
journalctl -u ratesengine-indexer -n 200 --no-pager | tail -40
# Look for: "source stream ended with error", "insert trade failed",
# "minio: object not found", "ledger metadata read".

# 3. Is Galexie producing fresh ledger objects?
sudo journalctl -u galexie -n 50 --no-pager
mc ls minio/galexie-live | tail -5      # newest objects within ~1 min
# OR if you suspect a network-state issue, query upstream directly
# (r1 has no local stellar-rpc; point at a public endpoint):
ratesengine-ops rpc-probe https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com
# Expect: version info + latest ledger close time within 60s.

# 4. Is Timescale reachable + writable?
PGCONNECT_TIMEOUT=3 psql -h db-primary.internal -U ratesengine \
  -d ratesengine -c "INSERT INTO ingestion_cursors (source, sub_source, last_ledger) VALUES ('probe', 'healthcheck', 0) ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING;"
```

Route by the result:

- Galexie isn't producing fresh objects in `galexie-live` → galexie's captive-core stalled or upstream network issue. Check `journalctl -u galexie`; if galexie itself is healthy, fall back to the public-rpc probe to confirm the network is closing ledgers.
- Galexie healthy + fresh objects in MinIO but indexer not reading → networking issue between indexer and MinIO, or indexer's MinIO credentials / endpoint config wrong. Check firewall, DNS, and `[ledgerstream]` config.
- psql INSERT fails → Timescale issue. Jump to [timescale-primary-down](timescale-primary-down.md).
- All probes pass but indexer produces no events → the indexer is alive but wedged. Likely deadlock or internal bug.

## Mitigation (≤ 15 min)

### A. Galexie / MinIO is the upstream problem

- Confirm galexie itself is healthy: `systemctl status galexie`,
  `journalctl -u galexie --since="10 min ago"`. galexie embeds its
  own captive-core; recoverable hangs typically clear with a
  service restart. Check disk pressure on `data/galexie`.
- Confirm fresh objects are landing in MinIO:
  `mc ls minio/galexie-live | tail -5`. The newest object should
  be within ~1 minute. If MinIO itself is unhealthy, follow
  whichever `redis-master-down`-style runbook applies (no
  dedicated MinIO runbook today).
- Wider network problem? `ratesengine-ops rpc-probe https://mainnet.sorobanrpc.com`
  confirms ledgers are still closing on the network — if the
  network is fine but galexie has stalled, capture logs and
  restart galexie.
- *Future-tense:* if a deployment routes through stellar-rpc
  rather than direct-MinIO ingest, [rpc-lag](rpc-lag.md) covers
  that path. r1 does not run stellar-rpc as of 2026-04-23.

### B. Timescale is the problem

- Proceed to [timescale-primary-down](timescale-primary-down.md).

### C. Indexer itself is wedged

- Capture a goroutine dump before restarting:
  ```sh
  kill -QUIT $(pgrep ratesengine-indexer)   # SIGQUIT dumps goroutines to stderr
  journalctl -u ratesengine-indexer -n 200 --no-pager > /tmp/indexer-dump-$(date +%s).log
  ```
- Restart the indexer:
  ```sh
  systemctl restart ratesengine-indexer
  # or
  kubectl -n ratesengine rollout restart deployment/ratesengine-indexer
  ```
- Confirm recovery:
  - `ratesengine_source_events_total` rate > 0 within 60 s.
  - Alert clears within 3 min.

### D. Recent deploy broke the indexer

- Check deploy history: last 4 h.
  ```sh
  # Tag history of releases — the CalVer convention is YYYY.MM.DD.N
  git tag -l '20*' --sort=-v:refname | head -10
  # Or: r1-deployment-state.md records the running version
  grep "^Running version" docs/operations/r1-deployment-state.md
  ```
- **Revert** to the previous release per
  [`release-process.md`](../release-process.md) §4.4 ("Rollback
  path"). The indexer ships as a systemd-managed binary, not a
  containerised service — so the revert is:
  ```sh
  # On each indexer host:
  PREVIOUS=2026.05.01.1                    # whichever tag was healthy
  ssh root@indexer-01 \
      "cd /opt/ratesengine/release-${PREVIOUS} && \
       systemctl stop ratesengine-indexer && \
       cp ratesengine-indexer /usr/local/bin/ && \
       systemctl start ratesengine-indexer && \
       systemctl status ratesengine-indexer --no-pager"
  # Repeat for every host in the inventory's ratesengine_indexer
  # group. The release archive (/opt/ratesengine/release-*) is
  # kept by goreleaser packaging convention; deploys leave the
  # previous N=3 releases in place for exactly this rollback.
  ```
  Then file a SEV-2 minimum + a postmortem in
  `docs/operations/postmortems/` per release-process.md §4.4.
- After revert, re-run diagnostics in step C.

## Root cause analysis

Gather:

- Goroutine dump from step C.
- Indexer logs `journalctl -u ratesengine-indexer --since "30 min ago"`.
- Grafana screenshots of `ratesengine_source_events_total` broken down by source — does it cliff-edge at a specific timestamp, or decay?
- Recent deploys — git log of `cmd/ratesengine-indexer/` in the last 72 h.
- Postgres `pg_stat_activity` during the window — were inserts blocked on locks?
- stellar-rpc's `getHealth` returned values during the window.

Patterns observed:

1. **Shared upstream down** — single dependency (stellar-rpc) dropped. Mitigation: add a second RPC endpoint; indexer round-robins.
2. **Shared storage backpressure** — Timescale insert latency spiked; indexer's output channel filled; all source goroutines blocked on `out <- evt`. Mitigation: indexer needs a buffered channel with drop-oldest policy for slow-consumer safety.
3. **Config-change caused source registry to be empty** — `ingestion.enabled_sources` accidentally set to `[]`. Mitigation: config loader (internal/config/load.go) to reject empty enabled_sources at startup, not just fatal in runtime.
4. **Panic in a source** — bad decoder blows up one goroutine + the watch goroutine waits forever. Mitigation: defer-recover in each source goroutine + orchestrator restart.

## Known false-positive patterns

- **Network event retention window rolled over** — stellar-rpc stopped serving the ledger range our cursor is in. The indexer correctly stops producing trade events while it seeks forward. Alert fires spuriously. Mitigation: tune the alert to look at `time() - ratesengine_source_last_event_unix` (staleness age) instead of raw rate.
- **Midnight UTC continuous-aggregate refresh** — the aggregator's heavy CAGG refresh briefly blocks trade inserts. Indexer queues up, then drains. Alert might fire at the window if duration is short. Tune `for: 3m → for: 5m` if this recurs.

## Changelog

- 2026-04-22 — initial draft. @ash.
- 2026-04-30 — quick-diagnosis + Mitigation A rewritten around
  Galexie + MinIO (the actual r1 upstream); rpc-probe URL points
  at a public stellar-rpc since r1 doesn't run its own
  (removed 2026-04-23). Symptoms drop the retired
  `ratesengine_ingestion_lag_high` reference.
