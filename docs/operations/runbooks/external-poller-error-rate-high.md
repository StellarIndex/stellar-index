# Runbook — `ratesengine_external_poller_error_rate_high`

## At a glance

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Alert | `ratesengine_external_poller_error_rate_high` |
| Severity | P3 (ticket) |
| Detected by | `deploy/monitoring/rules/external-pollers.yml` |
| Typical MTTR | 15–60 min |
| Impact | A specific external poller (CEX or FX vendor) is erroring on most of its scrapes. The aggregator falls back to its remaining sources for VWAP — the customer-visible price still serves but with `flags.reduced_redundancy=true` (ADR-0008). Sustained errors means a vendor is throttling, has changed schema, or is in maintenance. |

## Symptoms

- `sum by (source) (rate(ratesengine_external_poller_total{outcome="error"}[5m])) / sum by (source) (rate(ratesengine_external_poller_total[5m])) > 0.5` for ≥ 5 min.
- Aggregator log shows repeated `WARN poller error source={vendor}`.
- `/v1/sources?include=stats` shows the affected vendor with stale `last_event_unix`.

## Quick diagnosis (≤ 5 min)

```sh
# Which source(s) are erroring + at what rate
curl -s 'http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=sum%20by%20(source)%20(rate(ratesengine_external_poller_total%7Boutcome%3D%22error%22%7D%5B5m%5D))'

# The actual error message in the aggregator log
journalctl -u ratesengine-aggregator -n 500 --no-pager | grep -iE 'poller error.*source=' | tail -20

# Manual probe of the vendor endpoint with our typical request
# (replace BASE/QUERY for the affected venue per internal/sources/external/<vendor>/)
curl -sv 'https://api.coingecko.com/api/v3/simple/price?ids=stellar&vs_currencies=usd' 2>&1 | head -20
```

Key signals:
- **HTTP 429** → vendor rate-limit. Check our poll cadence vs their published cap; upgrade to a paid tier if traffic grows.
- **HTTP 401/403** → API key rotated or revoked; check the env var the binary reads (per `internal/sources/external/<vendor>/poller.go`).
- **HTTP 5xx** → vendor outage; check their status page.
- **Connect timeout** → DNS or network egress issue; jump to `host-network` diagnostics.
- **Schema parse error** → vendor changed their response shape; per CLAUDE.md "external sources" surprise list, this is recoverable but requires a code update.

## Mitigation (≤ 15 min)

- [ ] Step 1 — if HTTP 429, slow down the poll cadence in `[external_sources.<vendor>].poll_interval` (operator config) and restart the aggregator.
- [ ] Step 2 — if HTTP 401/403, rotate the API key env var via the secrets vault and restart.
- [ ] Step 3 — if vendor outage, no action needed; the aggregator's class-aware fallback (ADR-0008) keeps `/v1/price` serving from remaining sources. Update the status page only if `flags.reduced_redundancy=true` propagates to a customer-visible pair.
- [ ] Step 4 — if schema drift, the decoder needs a code update; jump to the source's dispatcher_adapter and update the parse path. Out-of-cycle release per `release-process.md`.
- [ ] Verification: error rate drops below 50% within 5 min of mitigation.

## Root cause analysis

For postmortem capture:
- Full poller log for the affected vendor over the previous 24 h.
- Vendor's status page screenshot at the time the alert fired.
- Diff of `internal/sources/external/<vendor>/parse.go` against the captured response if schema drift suspected.

## Known false-positive patterns

- **Short bursts during vendor maintenance windows** — most CEX vendors have published maintenance windows. Cross-reference the firing time against their status page before paging.
- **Network egress from R1 briefly degraded** — Hetzner has periodic single-AZ network blips that resolve within 2–5 min. The alert's `for: 5m` window captures this but a 6-min window can still squeak through.
