# r1-01 (FSN1) deployment state

Snapshot of what's running on the r1 host (Hetzner FSN1 dedicated;
public IP held in `configs/ansible/inventory/r1.yml`, gitignored)
as of 2026-04-26. Updated at each session.

## Hardware

- Intel Core Ultra 7 265 (20 cores — 8 P + 12 E)
- 192 GB DDR5 ECC (4 × 48 GB single-bit-ECC verified)
- 4 × 7.68 TB Samsung PM9A3 NVMe (datacenter-grade, 1 DWPD / 14 PBW)
- Hetzner dedicated, FSN1 datacenter (Falkenstein, Germany)
- Ubuntu 24.04.3 LTS noble

## Disk layout

```
nvme0n1 / nvme1n1 : OS mirror (mdadm RAID1)
                     p1  /boot/efi  512M  (per-drive vfat, not RAID)
                     p2  swap       4G    (md0, raid1)
                     p3  /          50G   (md1, raid1)
                     p4  ~7.63T     (ZFS raidz2 vdev)
nvme2n1 / nvme3n1 : untouched, full 7.68T (ZFS raidz2 vdevs)
```

ZFS pool `data` (raidz2, ~13.3 TB usable) with 5 datasets currently:
- `data/os` → `/var/lib/ratesengine`
- `data/postgres` → `/var/lib/postgresql` (recordsize=8K, logbias=throughput)
- `data/galexie` → `/var/lib/galexie`
- `data/minio` → `/var/lib/minio`
- `data/archive` → `/srv/history-archive`

The `data/core` and `data/rpc` datasets are gated behind
`run_stellar_core` / `run_stellar_rpc` in the ansible role
(`defaults/main.yml`); both default false since 2026-04-23 and
neither dataset exists on r1 today. Re-enable when validating
Phase-3 validator work.

## Services (systemd)

| Service | State 2026-04-23 | Notes |
|---------|------------------|-------|
| postgresql@15-main | active | |
| ~~stellar-core~~ | **REMOVED 2026-04-23** | Primary daemon dropped — archive pipeline doesn't need it; see [archival-nodes.md](../../discovery/data-sources/archival-nodes.md) for revival path in Phase 3. |
| ~~stellar-rpc~~ | **REMOVED 2026-04-23** | Redundant for our data path — our own indexer will consume galexie's MinIO output directly via `ingest.ApplyLedgerMetadata`. Public API is `/v1/price` + `/v1/vwap` + `/v1/twap` + `/v1/ohlc` + …, not `/rpc`. See §Architecture below. |
| galexie | active, exporting | Own captive-core; uploading `FC4A....xdr.zst` objects to MinIO galexie-live at ~1/ledger. ~100 objects/5min at steady state. **The single stellar-core on the box.** |
| minio | active | Buckets: `galexie-live`, `galexie-archive`, `backups` |
| node_exporter | active | :9100 |
| ~~stellar-core-prometheus-exporter~~ | **REMOVED 2026-04-23** | Scraped primary /info endpoint; captives don't expose one. |

One stellar-core on the box. Everything downstream of MinIO is a batch/stream consumer via the Ingest SDK — no more captive-cores.

## Stellar quorum set (trust anchors)

21 tier-1 validators across 7 orgs, identical to SDF's canonical
`packages/docs/examples/pubnet-validator-full/stellar-core.cfg`
fetched 2026-04-23:

- publicnode.org (3): Boötes, Lyra by BP Ventures, Hercules by OG Technologies
- lobstr.co (3): LOBSTR 1/2/5
- www.franklintempleton.com (3): FT SCV 1/2/3 *(archive frequently 404s, known upstream)*

## What's running in background

- ~~**`stellar-archivist mirror`**~~ — completed; `/srv/history-archive`
  is at 7.0 TB with the full pubnet history (used by `verify-archive`
  Tier B as the trusted reference). 59 zero-byte files left over
  from peer fetch failures during the initial run were re-fetched
  individually on 2026-04-26.

- **`galexie.service`** — live tail running continuously, currently
  appending `.xdr.zst` objects to `galexie-live/` at one per closed
  ledger. Live-tip ~62.3 M and tracking network head.

- **`galexie-archive` bucket** — historical backfill complete as of
  2026-04-26 (4.76 TB, 974 partitions covering ledgers 1 → ~62.3 M).
  Mirrored from the AWS public bucket via per-partition `mc mirror`
  (see [galexie-backfill.md](galexie-backfill.md) for the recovery
  runbook and the `mc mirror --overwrite=false` gotcha).

- **Healthchecks.io push every 5 min** reports service health +
  ledger-age + ZFS health + disk space. Healthchecks watches
  galexie + minio + postgresql + node_exporter (stellar-rpc is no
  longer in the watched set since its 2026-04-23 removal).

## Known gaps / next-session priorities

### Unblocked ✓
1. **Galexie PEER_PORT collision fixed — exports flowing.**
   (Updated 2026-04-23 14:03.) Earlier today galexie + stellar-rpc
   were stuck in a restart loop (152+ restarts); root cause was
   `PEER_PORT = 0` in captive-core.cfg getting stripped by the
   go-stellar-sdk toml marshaller (omitempty on zero), leaving
   stellar-core to default to pubnet's 11625 → collision with
   primary → SIGABRT. Fixed by giving each captive a distinct
   non-zero PEER_PORT (primary 11625, stellar-rpc captive 11725,
   galexie captive 11726) in separate /etc/stellar/captive-core*.cfg
   files. Commit `507e4de`. Post-fix: 0 restarts, captive-core
   reached network head at 62250034, galexie uploading one
   `.xdr.zst` object per closed ledger to `local/galexie-live/`.
   300+ objects landed within 5 min of sync. Ingestion pipeline
   is end-to-end working.

2. **SCVal decoders implemented.** (Updated 2026-04-26.) All 8 source
   decoders have real bodies — soroswap, aquarius, phoenix, reflector,
   sdex, comet, band, redstone — landed across PRs #5, #7, #15, #19
   plus subsequent fix-ups (Reflector OpIndex stride, Aquarius event
   fan-out, Redstone Bytes unwrap, Band ContractCallDecoder). Per-decoder
   unit-test coverage in flight (e.g. PR #148 pinning Band reject paths).
   **Open question** for full historical backfill: each decoder needs a
   per-WASM-hash audit before being turned loose on the 62 M-ledger
   replay — current decoders target current-WASM events; replay sees
   every prior version that ran during the range
   (see [docs/architecture/contract-schema-evolution.md](../architecture/contract-schema-evolution.md)).

### Important but not urgent
3. **Firewall + SSH hardening (phase 3)** not applied. Intentional —
   avoiding lockout risk until the box is stable. Keep KVM tab
   ready when we do.

3a. **`galexie-archive` is frozen at the historical-fill tip;
   `galexie-live` continues writing newer ledgers but to a
   different bucket.** (Discovered 2026-05-01.) The historical
   backfill that populated `galexie-archive` stopped on 2026-04-28
   at a verified tip of **62,249,727**; live galexie writes to
   `galexie-live` (per `/etc/galexie/galexie.toml`). Anything that
   reads from `galexie-archive` (eg `ratesengine-ops wasm-history`,
   `ratesengine-ops backfill`, `ratesengine-ops verify-archive-chunks`)
   MUST bound `-to` ≤ 62,249,727 OR fail with "ledger object …
   does not exist" on the partial trailing partition
   (FC49CDFF--62272000-62335999, currently 24,695/64,000 files).
   `detect-gaps` from 2026-04-28 02:39 found 242 gaps totalling
   459,966 missing ledgers, all clustered in the 40M-41M and
   44M-45M ranges (see `/var/lib/galexie/detect-gaps.json` on r1);
   the [50,457,424, 62,249,727] range that the wide-net walk
   targets is gap-free per that report.

   Fix options (operator):
   - Periodic `mc cp --recursive local/galexie-live/ local/galexie-archive/`
     after live ingest catches up, OR
   - Configure live galexie to write to `galexie-archive` directly
     and decommission `galexie-live`, OR
   - Make `ratesengine-ops` walkers consult both buckets at
     read-time (code change in `internal/datastore`).
   The first option is the simplest and matches the discovery
   plan's original design ("aws s3 sync post-mirror into
   galexie-archive bucket for durability" — see item 6 below).

4. **Layer-2 monitoring (Prometheus on a separate box)** is still
   TODO. Layer-1 (Healthchecks.io push) catches total-death but
   not per-metric alerts — we have 27 runbooks wired to alert
   rules nobody is evaluating yet.

5. **pgBackRest** not configured. Postgres has no backups.

6. **stellar-archivist mirror → MinIO sync.** Our mirror lands on
   ZFS (`/srv/history-archive/`), not in MinIO. Phase-1 plan
   called for `aws s3 sync` post-mirror into `galexie-archive`
   bucket for durability. TODO after mirror completes.

### Backlog (no urgency)
7. ~~Scope Galexie to a dedicated MinIO user with bucket-scoped
   write-only policy.~~ **Done — PR #156 (2026-04-23):** `galexie-writer`
   has write-only on `galexie-live`; `galexie-archive-writer` has
   write-only on `galexie-archive` (used during the historical fill);
   `ratesengine-reader` has read on both (PR #162, 2026-04-26).

8. Galexie's resume-from-last-ledger behaviour: wrapper currently
   restarts from `archive_tip - 128` every time. Long-term should
   probe MinIO for last-exported-ledger and resume past it.

## Configuration pitfalls captured during first deploy

These are all now fixed in the role, but noted so the lessons survive:

1. Captive-core runs WITH a separate primary stellar-core on one box
   → every captive-core child MUST set `HTTP_PORT=0` and a **non-zero**,
   **distinct** `PEER_PORT`. `PEER_PORT = 0` looks right but gets
   stripped by the go-stellar-sdk toml marshaller (the `PeerPort`
   field has `toml:"PEER_PORT,omitempty"` in toml.go:90), and
   stellar-core then falls back to the pubnet default 11625 — which
   the primary daemon owns. Collision manifests as
   `std::system_error(98, "Address already in use", "bind: …")` →
   SIGABRT → ingestion restart loop. Our layout: primary 11625,
   stellar-rpc captive 11725, galexie captive 11726. Every captive
   needs its OWN captive-core.cfg file since the port must differ
   per consumer. The parent must also pass
   `STELLAR_CAPTIVE_CORE_HTTP_PORT=0` to match `HTTP_PORT=0` in the
   captive file (stellar-rpc validates parent↔child agreement).

2. Galexie's config schema is `[datastore_config]` / `[stellar_core_config]`
   — not what older docs suggest. Match `config/config.example.toml`
   from the galexie source tree at the pinned tag.

3. stellar-core's config parser has no "return to root" — anything
   after `[SECTION]` is scoped to that section. Top-level directives
   (KNOWN_PEERS, NETWORK_PASSPHRASE, DATABASE, etc.) must come
   BEFORE any `[...]` or `[[...]]` block.

4. `apt-stellar-rpc`'s shipped `/etc/default/stellar-rpc` hard-codes
   futurenet. systemd's `EnvironmentFile` takes precedence over
   `--config-path`. Either blank the file, or drop `EnvironmentFile`
   from the unit. Our role does the latter.

5. Galexie's append subcommand requires an explicit `--start`
   ledger; there's no auto-discover. Wrapper must query an archive's
   `.well-known/stellar-history.json` (NOT stellar-core's live
   tip — archives lag 5-15 min) and subtract a safety margin.

6. The stellar-galexie tag format is `galexie-vX.Y.Z`, and there are
   no prebuilt binaries. Build from source via
   `go install github.com/stellar/stellar-galexie@galexie-vX.Y.Z`
   and copy (NOT symlink) out of `/root/go/bin/` into `/usr/local/bin/`
   because `/root` is mode 0700.

7. `[HISTORY.ratesengine]` (our local history-archive block with
   `put`/`mkdir` commands) must ONLY appear in the PRIMARY
   stellar-core config — never in any captive. Captive-cores that
   see `put`/`mkdir` assume they're supposed to publish checkpoints
   too; they then loop "Activating publish for ledger X" every 2s
   against an archive that hasn't been initialised (no
   `.well-known/stellar-history.json`) and ingestion stalls
   mid-ledger. Our template now gates the block on cfg_mode=='full'.

8. **stellar-rpc v26.0.0-189 requires CAPTIVE_CORE_CONFIG_PATH.**
   Tested 2026-04-23: writing a cfg with just the datastore stanzas
   (`[datastore_config]` + `[buffered_storage_backend_config]`)
   and `SERVE_LEDGERS_FROM_DATASTORE = true` but no captive-core
   path makes stellar-rpc exit on startup with "captive-core-config-path
   is required". The `SERVE_LEDGERS_FROM_DATASTORE` flag is an
   augmentation for historical-fallback reads, not a replacement
   for captive-core-driven live ingestion. Closes the open item
   in docs/discovery/data-sources/composable-data-platform.md.
   **For Phase 1 we run captive + datastore-fallback (see
   templates/stellar-rpc.cfg.j2).** To get to 1-captive-core on
   the box, either wait for a stellar-rpc release that supports
   captive-less mode, or drop stellar-rpc and build our own
   consumer around `ingest.ApplyLedgerMetadata` from the galexie
   datastore.
