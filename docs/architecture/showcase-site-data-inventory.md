# Showcase site — data, IA, and API plan

**Codename:** none yet — referred to as "the showcase" in this doc.
**Domain (proposed):** `app.ratesengine.net` for the site,
`docs.ratesengine.net` already serves the auto-generated API
reference.

This doc is the **single planning artefact** for the customer-facing
explorer. It captures: who it's for, the design principles, the URL
scheme, every page, every panel, every API call (existing or new),
every schema addition, the build order, and the performance budget.

It supersedes the v0 sketch from earlier in this file's history.

> **Status:** planning. Nothing here is binding until split into
> implementation tickets. The doc itself becomes the contract for
> those tickets.

## 1. Mission

Two goals, weighted equally:

1. **Showcase what the API can do.** Every visible piece of data is
   backed by a single, copy-pasteable public API call. The site
   doubles as the most thorough living tutorial for the API — every
   panel exposes its underlying request via a `<>` reveal.
2. **Be genuinely useful.** Stellar users tracking holdings,
   researchers investigating incidents, internal team debugging,
   and curious public alike should each find the site answers
   their real questions — not a demo facade.

If a feature only serves goal 1 (showy) or only serves goal 2
(useful but doesn't expose API capability), it's a v2 candidate.
v1 ships features that hit both.

---

## 2. Audiences

| Audience | Primary needs | Where they live on the site |
|---|---|---|
| **Stellar users** (token holders, traders) | "What's my asset doing? Is it healthy? Where's the best price?" | `/coins/*`, `/pairs/*`, `/markets`, `/anchors/*`, watchlist |
| **Researchers / journalists** | "What happened during this incident? Show me the data, let me cite it." | `/research/*` (blog), deep-link URLs into every view, `/tx/*`, `/contracts/*` |
| **Builders** (integrators, oracle consumers) | "What does the API return? How do I call it? Is it reliable?" | `<>` reveals everywhere, `/docs`, `/sources/*`, `/diagnostics` |
| **Internal team + auditors** | "Is the system healthy? Did we miss anything?" | `/diagnostics`, `/anomalies`, `/divergences`, `/sources/*` |
| **General public** | "Show me the cool stuff." | `/`, `/coins/*`, top-movers widgets, live trade tape |

Same site, no mode toggle. Information density rises gracefully —
every page shows the answer above the fold, with progressive
disclosure into the deep data underneath.

---

## 3. Design principles

These are the rules every design decision must answer to.

1. **Panels = API queries, 1:1.** No panel transforms or joins data
   beyond what the underlying endpoint returns. If the UI wants
   something the API can't shape, it becomes a gap-list entry — not
   a client-side join. This keeps the `<>` reveal honest and forces
   API completeness.
2. **`<>` reveals the request.** Every panel has a button (top-right
   of each card) that shows the exact `curl` (or `wscat` for SSE)
   that produced the data, with copy-to-clipboard. Doubles as live
   API documentation.
3. **URL state is config.** Every selection — `as_of_ledger`,
   selected sources, chart range, overlays, compared assets, sort
   order, filters — lives in the URL query string. Reload-safe,
   share-safe, deep-linkable. Required for the blog-post-with-links
   pattern (§14) and the time machine (§13).
4. **Anonymous-readable.** Free-tier rate limit covers the showcase.
   Authenticated views (account, keys, usage) live behind sign-in
   on `/account`. Everything else is open.
5. **No mode toggle.** Internal-vs-external split is a UX trap.
   Same site for everyone; deep data is one click below the
   surface, not behind a flag.
6. **Mobile-first.** Single-column collapse, touch-friendly chart
   controls, swipe-up `<>` sheet on mobile.
7. **Performance is a feature.** LCP < 1.5s on 3G; JS bundle
   < 100 KB gzipped per route; static-render where possible (§24).
8. **Server-shaped, not client-joined.** If a panel needs three
   things, we add an endpoint that returns the three things shaped
   for the panel. One round trip, one cache key.
9. **Sortable by default.** Every list is sortable on every column,
   reflected in the URL.
10. **Open Graph cards everywhere.** Every page renders a rich OG
    image showing its current state for Twitter/Slack/Discord
    previews.

## 4. URL scheme

CoinGecko-inspired, base-asset-centric. **Quote is a sub-route**;
when omitted, defaults to `usd`.

## 6. Cross-cutting view primitives

These compose throughout the site. Specify them once, use everywhere.

### 6.1 Multi-window delta strip

Wherever a number appears, it's accompanied by colour-coded multi-window deltas:

```
$0.1234   1h: +0.5%  ·  24h: +3.2%  ·  7d: −1.1%  ·  30d: +18.4%
```

Powered by `GET /v1/changes/{entity_type}/{id}` (§9.6).

### 6.2 Sparkline

Inline 7-day mini-chart next to every entity in every list. Server-rendered SVG, ~1 KB each. Cached per-entity for 5 min. Endpoint: `GET /v1/sparkline/{entity_type}/{id}?window=7d`.

### 6.3 Direction pill

Arrow + % chip; colour graduated:

```
↗ +1-5%      light green
↗↗ +5-20%    green
↗↗↗ >+20%    bright green
↘ same scale, red
→ <±0.5%     grey
```

### 6.4 Streak indicator

```
↗ 14 days up     green
ATH 2h ago       gold
ATL 3 days ago   red
new pair         purple (last 24h)
```

### 6.5 Rank-change badge

```
▲ 2     moved up 2 spots since yesterday
▼ 1     moved down 1
—       unchanged
NEW     entered the leaderboard
```

### 6.6 Acceleration arrow

Used sparingly on hero metrics. Combines first + second derivative:

```
↗↗   accelerating up      (+ +)
↗→   steady up            (+ flat)
↗↘   decelerating up      (+ −)
↘↘   accelerating down    (− −)
↘→   steady down          (− flat)
↘↗   recovering           (− +)
```

### 6.7 Source contribution donut

For any aggregated price: shows the % weight of each contributing source. Hover a wedge → see that source's last trade ledger and current price contribution. Endpoint: `GET /v1/price/{base}/{quote}/sources`.

### 6.8 Confidence decomposition card

Hero number with factor breakdown:

```
Confidence: 87/100
  ✓ 6 sources      (target: ≥3)
  ✓ σ = 0.3%       (target: <2%)
  ✓ Divergence 0.4% vs Chainlink   (target: <2%)
  ✓ Baseline fresh: 4 min ago
  ✓ Depth: $2.4M
```

Already returned by `/v1/price` as `confidence_factors`.

### 6.9 TVL chart with annotations

Every protocol/asset chart can overlay event markers (WASM upgrades, anomaly events, large flows). Markers are clickable → link to the underlying tx or contract.

### 6.10 The `<>` reveal

Top-right of every card. Opens a tray showing:

```
GET https://api.ratesengine.net/v1/price/native/fiat:USD?as_of_ledger=62405155
Authorization: not required (anonymous tier)

Response (200):
{ "data": { ... }, "as_of": "...", "sources": [...] }
```

With "copy as cURL", "copy URL", and "open in API explorer" buttons.

## 7. Page inventory

Every page lists its panels. Each panel has: name, what it shows, the API call (existing or new), and status (`✅ exposed today` / `⚠️ partial` / `❌ new`).

### §7.1 Landing (`/`)

The above-the-fold sells the system. Below: macro context.

| Row | Panel | Shows | API call | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Pulse banner** | "X assets · Y trades/sec · Z sources live · ledger N · lag T" | `GET /v1/diagnostics/pulse` | ❌ new |
| 1 | **Live trade tape** | Streaming list of every trade (source, pair, price, size) | `GET /v1/observations/stream?asset=*` | ❌ new (wildcard) |
| 2 | **Total Stellar TVL** | Aggregate with sparkline + multi-window deltas | `GET /v1/tvl?range=30d` | ❌ new |
| 2 | **Network volume 24h** | Total cross-protocol volume + delta | `GET /v1/network/volume?window=24h` | ❌ new |
| 2 | **Active sources** | Live count + freshest-source widget | `GET /v1/sources?live=true` | ⚠️ partial |
| 3 | **Top movers (24h gainers)** | Top 5 assets + delta + sparkline | `GET /v1/coins?sort=delta_24h:desc&limit=5` | ❌ new (sort + delta cols) |
| 3 | **Top movers (24h losers)** | Symmetric to gainers | Same endpoint, ascending | ❌ new |
| 3 | **Top volume 24h** | Top 5 pairs by USD volume | `GET /v1/pairs?sort=volume_24h_usd:desc&limit=5` | ❌ new (sort) |
| 4 | **Top protocols by TVL** | Leaderboard with rank changes | `GET /v1/protocols?sort=tvl:desc` | ❌ new |
| 4 | **TVL flow Sankey (30d)** | Money moving between protocols | `GET /v1/tvl/flow?from=…&to=…` | ❌ new |
| 5 | **Live anomaly banner** | "Frozen now: 2 pairs (PHOENIX/USDC, AQUA/USD)" | `GET /v1/anomalies?status=firing` | ❌ new |
| 5 | **Recent freeze events** | Last N freeze decisions, one-line each | `GET /v1/anomalies?since=24h&limit=10` | ❌ new |
| 6 | **New listings feed** | SEP-41 contracts discovered last 24h | `GET /v1/discovered?since=24h&limit=20` | ❌ new |
| 6 | **Recent WASM upgrades** | Contract upgrades last 7d | `GET /v1/contracts/wasm-upgrades?since=7d` | ❌ new |
| 7 | **Stellar weather strip** | Composite health indicators | `GET /v1/network/health` | ❌ new |

### §7.2 Coin directory (`/coins`)

CoinGecko-style table with full sort + filter.

| Panel | Shows | API call |
|---|---|---|
| **Asset table** | rank, slug, name, ticker, price, Δ1h, Δ24h, Δ7d, Δ30d, market cap, volume 24h, supply, sparkline 7d | `GET /v1/coins?sort=…&filter=…&cursor=…&limit=100` |
| **Filter rail** | type (native/classic/soroban/fiat), source class, anchor verified, has-volume-24h, has-soroswap-pair | Query params on the same endpoint |
| **Search bar** | Type-ahead by ticker, code, contract id, anchor domain | `GET /v1/search?q=…&type=coin` |
| **View toggle** | Table / Grid / Tree-map by market cap | Frontend-only |

The `/v1/coins` endpoint is the **registry-aware superset** of `/v1/assets` — it's `/v1/assets` joined with `classic_assets`, `discovered_assets`, and the `change_summary_5m` rollup so the table renders in one round-trip.

### §7.3 Coin detail (`/coins/{slug}` or `/coins/{slug}/{quote}`)

| **Per-vault exposure** (aggregator protocols) | One row per vault contract — capital allocation per underlying protocol | `GET /v1/protocols/{slug}/vaults` | ❌ new (see §7.9.1) |

### §7.9.1 Router + aggregator attribution (cross-cutting)

Soroswap and DeFindex are both **routers / aggregators**: their on-chain entry points (`SoroswapRouter`, DeFindex vault contracts) wrap underlying liquidity venues. The interesting question is "where does the money actually land?" — and from the underlying venue's POV, "how much of my volume is routed-in vs direct?"

This is a **cross-cutting attribution layer**, not a per-protocol panel. It powers four places on the site:

1. **Soroswap protocol page** — router-attribution donut: how much of Soroswap-routed volume hits Soroswap pairs vs Phoenix vs Aquarius vs SDEX.
2. **DeFindex (and any aggregator) protocol page** — exposure chart: where is the deposited capital deployed underneath, per underlying protocol.
3. **Underlying venues' protocol pages** (Phoenix, Aquarius, SDEX, Blend) — routed-in share: what % of my flow is direct vs via a router/aggregator.
4. **Per-pair page** (§7.4) — "this trade hit Phoenix via Soroswap router" badge on each row of the live tape.

#### How attribution works

When a tx invokes a known router/aggregator contract, every trade or state-change event emitted by the **same tx batch** is attributed to that router. Mechanism:

- Maintain a `routers` registry: `(contract_id, name, kind, protocol_slug)`. Seeded from known router/vault contracts; auto-discovery extends it (see decoder hook below).
- Dispatcher's `ContractCallDecoder` fires on any invocation of a router contract. The dispatcher pushes the `routed_via` tag into a per-tx context.
- Every trade inserted from the same tx batch gets a `routed_via` column populated.
- For aggregator vaults (DeFindex), additional layer: when a vault invokes an underlying protocol (e.g. Blend's `submit`), the resulting Blend state-change is tagged with `routed_via=defindex` AND captures the specific vault contract id for vault-level breakdown.

Attribution is **post-hoc and additive**: a Phoenix swap remains a Phoenix trade in the trades hypertable (so Phoenix volume is unchanged); the `routed_via` column is just an extra dimension you can group by.

#### What about multi-hop routes?

A single tx can route through multiple pools (`A → Soroswap pair X → Phoenix pool Y → Aquarius pool Z`). Each leg emits its own underlying event; **all legs share the same `routed_via` tag** because they're all in the same tx batch. The router's tx → 3 trades, all tagged `routed_via=soroswap-router`.

#### What about nested routers?

A DeFindex vault could deposit into Blend, which itself triggers an internal swap. The first router observed on the call stack wins (`routed_via=defindex`); the inner Blend interaction is captured as a separate dimension via the aggregator-specific tracking on `aggregator_exposures` (§9.9). No need to support arbitrary nesting at v1.

## 8. Time machine

Every endpoint accepts `as_of_ledger=N` (or `as_of=ISO`, resolved to ledger). Default = live tip.

### 8.1 What "as of" means

For each endpoint shape:
- **Point-in-time** (`/v1/price`): the closed-bucket VWAP whose window contains ledger N.
- **Range** (`/v1/history?from=…&to=…&as_of_ledger=N`): the data as it WAS at N — so `to` is clamped to N if `to > N`. (Bigger ranges with `as_of_ledger` in the past simulate "what we knew then.")
- **Lists** (`/v1/coins`, `/v1/protocols`): only entities that existed by ledger N (filter on `first_seen_ledger ≤ N`).
- **Live tip** (`/v1/price/tip`): meaningful only when N is recent; for historical N, returns the closed-bucket containing N (not the tip).
- **WASM detail** (`/v1/contracts/{id}/wasm/{hash}`): hash-keyed, no time dependency.

### 8.2 Implementation

A **single helper** `pinTime(ctx, asOfLedger)` in `internal/api/v1/timepin/` that every handler routes through. Centralizes the projection logic. New endpoints get it for free; existing endpoints add one line.

CAGG reads use `time_bucket()` aligned to `as_of_ledger`'s wall-clock; trades hypertable filters on `ledger ≤ N`; cursor lookups + registry queries filter on `first_seen_ledger ≤ N`.

### 8.3 UX

- **Top-right global widget on every page** — current "as of" indicator. Live = no badge. Historical = orange "🕓 Viewing as of ledger 50,123,456 · 2025-09-12T13:42Z" with a "Back to live" button.
- **Ledger picker** — modal accepting ledger #, ISO date, or "N hours/days ago." Resolves to ledger via `/v1/ledgers/at?ts=…`.
- **URL-shareable** — every page's URL carries `as_of_ledger` so links Just Work.
- **Frozen mode styling** — historical pages get a subtle off-tone (warm yellow tint) so you can never confuse historical with live. Charts grey out the future.

### 8.4 Cost

The audit work isn't compute — it's **discipline**. Every new endpoint must accept `as_of_ledger`. Code review enforces it. The single helper makes it cheap; without that discipline you end up with half-broken historical state.

-- Aggregator-vault exposure: capital allocation per (vault, underlying protocol).

    vault_contract_id  text         NOT NULL,
    underlying_protocol text         NOT NULL,    -- "blend", "aquarius", "soroswap", …

    ON aggregator_exposures (vault_contract_id, observed_at DESC);
CREATE INDEX aggregator_exposures_protocol_idx
    ON aggregator_exposures (underlying_protocol, observed_at DESC);
```

**Backfill:** mechanical. For each known router contract, walk the
trades hypertable and the dispatcher's contract-call observations,
tag any same-tx trades. For DeFindex, walk Blend / Aquarius / etc.
state-change events from any known vault contract and write
`aggregator_exposures` rows.

## 11. Decoder + writer extensions

What the Go side has to add. Roughly grouped by feature.

### 11.1 Classic-asset registry (§7.13/§7.14)

- New `internal/sources/classic_registry/` observer:
  - Hooks on every trade in the `trades` hypertable (post-insert trigger or aggregator-side worker).
  - Upserts `classic_assets` row per `(code, issuer)`.
  - On observing a new issuer, enqueues SEP-1 fetch.
- New SEP-1 fetcher worker — wraps existing `internal/metadata`. Rate-limits outbound HTTPS (10 RPS), respects robots.txt + `X-RateLimit-*`, retries with backoff.
- New observer extends `accounts` decoder to capture issuer-account auth flag changes → write to `issuers`.

### 11.2 TVL aggregation (§7.8 / §7.9 / §7.21)

- New aggregator-side worker `internal/aggregate/tvl/`:
  - Every aggregator tick (1 min): for each known protocol, sum `reserve_a × price_a + reserve_b × price_b` over its pools.
  - Writes one row per (protocol, tick) to `tvl_observations`.
  - Uses `lp_reserve_observations` + latest `prices_1m` CAGG.

### 11.3 Persistence wiring (currently Redis-only)

- **Freeze events**: `internal/aggregate/freeze` already detects + emits the flag; add a sink that writes to `freeze_events` on every state transition (clear→firing, firing→clear).
- **Divergence observations**: `internal/divergence/worker.go` already computes; add a sink writing each comparison to `divergence_observations`.
- **Decoder stats**: aggregator periodically reads `dispatcher.Stats()` via a metrics hook + writes to `decoder_stats_5m`.
- **TVL**: above.

### 11.4 MEV detection (§7.20)

- New worker `internal/aggregate/mev/`:
  - Sandwich detector: walks `trades` hypertable for matching pre/post-trade pairs in same tx batch with reversal.
  - Oracle-deviation detector: cross-references `oracle_updates` with `prices_1m`, flags >Nσ events.
  - Liquidation cascade: clusters Blend auction events temporally, correlates with price moves.
  - Writes detected events to `mev_events` with full provenance.
- One pass at start for backfill, then incremental on new ledgers.

### 11.5 WASM history materialization

- New `internal/wasm/` package:
  - Watches `UploadContractWasm` ops + `ContractCode` LedgerEntry creates → upserts `wasm_versions`.
  - Watches `ContractData` LedgerEntry changes touching the executable instance → upserts `contract_wasm_history`.
- One-shot backfill from existing `wasm-history` JSONL on r1.
- API handler `GET /v1/contracts/{id}/wasm/{hash}/wat` uses cgo binding to `wabt` (libwasm + wasm2wat). Cache by hash, indefinite TTL (immutable). LRU in-process.

### 11.6 Change-summary rollup (§9.6)

- New aggregator-side worker that, every 5 min, walks every `(entity_type, entity_id)` and computes the multi-window deltas + ATH/ATL + streak + acceleration. Writes to `change_summary_5m`.
- O(N) per refresh where N = entity count (~10k assets + 10 protocols + 200 pairs + 30 sources). Trivial cost.

### 11.7 Search index

- Add tsvector column to `coins`, `issuers`, `contracts`. GIN index. `pg_trgm` for fuzzy matching on tickers + names.
- Search endpoint dispatches across types, merges, ranks by trgm similarity + recency.

### 11.8 SEP-1 rate-limiting

- The only outbound HTTPS we add. Per `home_domain`: max 1 RPS, retry with exponential backoff, weekly stale-cache acceptance. Background worker runs nightly + on-demand for newly-discovered issuers.

### 11.9 Router + aggregator attribution (§7.9.1)

- New `internal/sources/router_attribution/` observer:
  - Hooks the dispatcher's `ContractCallDecoder` for every contract in the `routers` registry. (Same plumbing the Band oracle decoder uses today — no new dispatcher seam.)
  - When a router invocation is observed, pushes `routed_via=<router_name>` into a tx-scoped context that lives across the rest of the tx batch.
  - Trades inserted by other decoders within the same tx batch read the context + populate `trades.routed_via`.
- **Router seed**: ship the registry pre-populated with known router contracts at v1:
  - `SoroswapRouter` (current + historical WASM versions discovered via `wasm-history`).
  - `DefindexFactory` + a curated list of vault contracts derived from factory `new_vault` events.
  - Extends as new routers come online — auto-discovery heuristic flags candidates (contracts that frequently invoke ≥2 underlying-protocol contracts in single tx batches), an operator promotes confirmed ones into the registry.
- **DeFindex aggregator-exposure tracker**: separate from the per-tx routed-via tagging. A periodic worker that, for each known DeFindex vault contract, queries its on-chain state (vault token holdings, deposited amounts in underlying protocols) and writes `aggregator_exposures` rows. Frequency: same as TVL ticker (1 min).
- **Backfill**: walk historical txs that invoked any known router contract, tag the trades they generated. Walk Blend / Aquarius / etc. state-change events from any known vault, write `aggregator_exposures` rows.

**Gotchas:**
- Router contract WASM versioning: a router can be upgraded; function names / signatures may change. Per-WASM-hash decoder audit (the existing CLAUDE.md "Soroban DeFi contracts upgrade in place" rule) applies. Gate backfill against unaudited router WASM.
- DeFindex vault discovery is open-ended; ship at v1 with a curated allowlist, add auto-discovery heuristic in a follow-up.
- "Routing through a router that itself routes through another router" (nested routers) — at v1, attribute to the outermost router only. Don't try to support arbitrary nesting until we see it in the wild.

### 12.2 Build pipeline

- Posts live in `posts/*.md` in this repo (or a sibling content repo).
- Next.js MDX renderer compiles each post to a static page.
- `<RatesLink>` and `<RatesPanel>` resolve to `/coins/...`, `/contracts/...`, `/anomalies/...` URLs with the right `as_of_ledger` baked in.
- Hover-preview shows a thumbnail of the linked panel; click navigates with full URL state.
- Articles are SEO-friendly + sharable. OG cards render the headline metric.

### 12.3 Why this beats a custom incident page

- Reusability: each post is prose + links. No new UI per incident.
- Verifiability: every claim has a `<>` reveal showing the API call.
- Linkable: any external article (Twitter, blog, audit report) can use the same `RatesLink` pattern via plain URLs.
- Time machine integration is automatic — post body uses `as_of_ledger` URLs that just work.

## 13. URL state — reference

```
/coins/stellar/usdc?as_of_ledger=50115423&tab=chart&granularity=1m&timeframe=1h&sources=binance,kraken&compare=stellar,aqua&panel=confidence-card
```

Decomposition:
- `coin = stellar`, `quote = usdc` from path
- `as_of_ledger = 50115423` — time machine
- `tab = chart` — active tab
- `granularity = 1m`, `timeframe = 1h` — chart settings
- `sources = binance,kraken` — overlay restriction
- `compare = stellar,aqua` — multi-asset overlay
- `panel = confidence-card` — anchored sub-view

Frontend principle: every reactive setting reads from + writes to URL query params. Use `useSearchParams` + `router.replace` everywhere. No local state for anything URL-encodable.

## 14. Comparison & overlay tools

### 14.1 Multi-asset overlay (`?compare=…`)

Available on every coin chart. Each asset is added as a layer normalized to `% change from window start`. Up to 5 assets. Chart legend shows colour, current %, 24h delta.

### 14.2 Multi-source overlay (`?sources=…`)

On pair charts. Each source becomes its own line. Toggle all-on / all-off. Useful for spotting which source led / lagged.

### 14.3 Multi-protocol overlay

On pair detail pages. Same pair on Soroswap vs Phoenix vs Aquarius vs SDEX. Stacked or overlaid view.

### 14.4 Quadrant chart

`/coins?view=quadrant`. x = price 24h%, y = volume 24h%. Each asset = dot. Top-right = healthy momentum; bottom-right = price up but no volume (suspicious). Brushing selects a subset; click a dot to navigate.

### 14.5 Calendar heatmap

GitHub-style grid. Used on:
- Asset pages — daily trade count.
- Protocol pages — daily new pairs / WASM upgrades.
- Anomaly page — daily freeze count.

---

## 15. Universal search

Top-of-every-page bar. Categorized type-ahead; results page at `/search?q=…`.

### 15.1 Result categories

- **Coins** (asset slug, ticker, name, code-issuer)
- **Issuers** (G-strkey, home_domain)
- **Anchors** (home_domain, org name)
- **Contracts** (C-strkey, protocol-known names)
- **Transactions** (tx hash; usually direct match)
- **Accounts** (G-strkey)
- **Articles** (research post titles + tags)

### 15.2 Ranking

- Exact match at top
- Trigram similarity for fuzzy matches
- Recency boost (recently active assets / contracts > dormant)
- Popularity boost (by 24h volume / view count if we track)

### 15.3 Cmd-K

Keyboard shortcut opens search modal. Every page.

---

## 16. Embeds + integrations

### 16.1 Iframe embeds

Every chart, donut, metric has a "Share / Embed" button. Generates:

```html
<iframe src="https://app.ratesengine.net/embed/chart?coin=stellar&quote=usdc&granularity=1h&timeframe=24h"
        width="800" height="400" frameborder="0"></iframe>
```

URL-state-encoded so the embedded view is exactly what the embedder configured.

### 16.2 Open Graph

Every page: rich OG image.

- `/coins/stellar/usdc` → image showing current price, sparkline, 24h delta.
- `/research/reflector-blend-2025-03-14` → image of the headline metric.
- Generated by an `embed/og/*` worker; cached for 5 min.

### 16.3 Wallet portfolio

`/account` with sign-in: Stellar wallet → see your portfolio valued through our prices. Read-only. Shows balances, total USD value, 24h change. Uses our existing price endpoints + the user's account state from `/v1/accounts/{G}`.

### 16.4 SEP-40 oracle reader demo

A panel on `/oracles` shows live-streaming output of a reference SEP-40 oracle reader hitting our `/v1/oracle/lastprice` endpoint. Code visible in a `<>` reveal so integrators can copy.

## 17. Build order

Independent shipping units. Each unblocks the next.

| Phase | Work | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| **0. Pre-work** | Migrations 0017-0024 + backfills | Tables exist + populated from history |
| **1. High-priority API endpoints** | Source breakdown, supply history, supply breakdown, volatility, change-summary, sparkline, diagnostics | Most panels can render; thin wrappers over data we already have |
| **2. Persistence wiring** | Freeze events sink, divergence sink, decoder-stats flush, TVL writer, MEV worker | Currently-Redis-only state lands in postgres |
| **3. Classic-asset registry** | Observer + SEP-1 worker + endpoints | Issuer/anchor pages work; classic asset coverage explodes |
| **4. WASM materialization** | wasm_versions + contract_wasm_history + WAT endpoint | Contract pages work with full history |
| **5. Time machine** | `pinTime` helper + every endpoint takes `as_of_ledger` | URL state is fully time-shiftable |
| **6. Frontend scaffold** | Next.js app, layout, design system primitives (§6) | Empty pages, shared components |
| **7. Landing + coin directory + coin detail** | The most-visited pages | Site is "browsable" |
| **8. Pair / market / source / oracle pages** | Mid-tier pages | Most surfaces live |
| **9. Protocol + contract explorer** | Depends on phase 4 | WASM time machine surfaces |
| **10. Issuer / anchor / tx / account pages** | Depends on phase 3 | Stellar primitives surface |
| **11. Anomaly / divergence / MEV / network / diagnostics** | Operator-friendly views | Internal team can ditch the CLI |
| **12. Research + embeds + sign-in** | Articles, OG, iframe, wallet integration | Marketing-ready |
| **13. Polish + perf budget** | Bundle splits, ISR tuning, mobile pass | Launch quality |

Phases 1-5 are backend-only. Phases 6+ are frontend (with backend additions discovered along the way).

Realistic: phases 0-5 ≈ 2-3 weeks of backend work, phases 6-13 ≈ 4-6 weeks of frontend. ~6-9 weeks total to a polished v1.

---

## 18. Performance budget

- **LCP < 1.5s** on 3G mobile, p95.
- **JS bundle < 100 KB gzipped per route** (per Next.js app router).
- **API p95 < 200 ms** for any endpoint (already covered by k6 SLA proof).
- **Static generation + ISR** for everything except SSE + authenticated + time-machine views.
- **Lightweight Charts** (~30 KB gzipped) over full TradingView library (~2 MB).
- **CDN absorbs anonymous traffic** per `cdn-setup.md`. Authenticated routes bypass.
- **Per-page bundle splits** — `/coins/*` doesn't ship `/protocols/*` JS.
- **Skeleton states everywhere** — no layout shift; every panel reserves its area.
- **Image optimization** — Next.js Image component; AVIF/WebP fallbacks.
- **Font subsetting** — single weight + italic variant; Latin + Latin-Extended only.
- **No third-party trackers** at v1.

---

## 19. Cross-cutting concerns

### 19.1 Caching

Every public endpoint uses the cache-control matrix from ADR-0018 / `cdn-setup.md`. New endpoints follow the same pattern:

| Surface | Cache header |
|---|---|
| Closed-bucket VWAPs, history, OHLC, since-inception | `public, max-age=60, s-maxage=300` |
| Tip prices | `public, max-age=1` |
| Asset / coin / protocol catalogues | `public, max-age=60, s-maxage=300` |
| Account, auth, embed-OG | `private, no-store` |
| SSE streams | `no-store` |
| WASM bytecode (immutable) | `public, max-age=31536000, immutable` |

### 19.2 Rate limits

- Anonymous: 60 req/min — fine for normal browse.
- Authenticated: 1000 req/min.
- Embeds: same anonymous limit, so an embedder needs to use cached iframes (Cache-Control). OG image cache covers most of this.

### 19.3 Auth

Only `/account/*` is auth-required. SEP-10 challenge → JWT. Wallet integrations: Freighter, Albedo, Lobstr at v1.

### 19.4 i18n

English-only at v1. URL pattern is `i18n-ready` (no `/en/` prefix today, can add via redirect later). Number formatting is Intl-aware client-side.

### 19.5 Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA target.
- Every chart has a screen-reader-friendly fallback table.
- Colour-blind palettes on heatmaps + multi-line charts.
- Keyboard nav on every interactive element.

### 19.6 Per-region consistency

All closed-bucket endpoints already return identical results across regions (ADR-0015). Tip + raw surfaces are explicitly per-region. UI badges this in the freshness indicator on tip-derived widgets.

## 20. Open questions

To answer before frontend scaffolding starts:

1. **Hosting:** static + CDN with ISR (Vercel/Netlify), or self-hosted Next.js on r1? Static covers everything except SSE which clients hit directly.
2. **Wallet UX:** Freighter only at v1 vs Freighter + Albedo + Lobstr? Freighter has 80%+ market share.
3. **Repo layout:** monorepo (`web/showcase/`) or separate repo? Monorepo simpler for typed API client sharing.
4. **MDX content repo:** in-tree (`posts/*.md`) or sibling repo?
5. **Brand:** colour palette, logo, typography — needs a brief design pass.
6. **Embeds:** allow arbitrary domains, or whitelist? Whitelist for v1.
7. **Slug ownership:** when two issuers issue assets with the same code (USDC-Circle vs USDC-Anchor), which gets the bare `/coins/usdc`? Volume-weighted dominant by default; admin-overridable in `classic_assets.slug`.
8. **MEV detection thresholds:** sandwich detection has a high false-positive rate. Curated allowlist of known MEV bots vs algorithmic? Probably algorithmic with a confidence score.
9. **OG image generator:** Vercel `@vercel/og` (best DX), Satori, or pure server-side Canvas? Decide once we're picking the framework.
10. **`as_of_ledger` UX:** is the off-tone styling enough to prevent confusion, or do we also disable certain panels (live tape, "currently firing")? Probably disable.
