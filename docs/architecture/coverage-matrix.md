# RFP × Proposal × Delivery Coverage Matrix

**Ratified:** 2026-04-22.
**Purpose:** one authoritative table mapping every contractual requirement
to the mechanism that satisfies it. Supersedes the narrower
`docs/discovery/rfp-requirements-matrix.md` (which remains valid as
the source-discovery artefact).

## How to read this doc

Each row captures **one atomic requirement** from either RFP, sourced
verbatim from:

- [docs/stellar-rfp.md](../stellar-rfp.md) — Stellar Prices API RFP.
- [docs/freighter-rfp.md](../freighter-rfp.md) — Freighter asset-detail RFP.

For each row:

| Column | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| **Requirement** | Verbatim or close paraphrase of the RFP bullet. |
| **Proposal commitment** | Where our `docs/ctx-proposal.md` commits to it. |
| **Delivery week** | Which week in [docs/discovery/delivery-plan.md](../discovery/delivery-plan.md) implements it. |
| **Owner binary / package** | The Go `cmd/*` or `internal/*` that delivers it. |
| **ADR** | The architectural decision that binds the implementation. |
| **Verified by** | The discovery doc whose primary-source work proves feasibility. |
| **Status** | `✅ verified`, `🧪 designed, impl pending`, `⏳ deferred`, `⚠ caveat`, `❌ gap`. |
| **Confidence** | Honest 1–5 score: 5 = code+tests, 1 = hand-wave. |

Any row with **status ❌** is a blocker for launch. Any row with
**confidence ≤ 2** is a risk line in the Week-N review.

## Claim verification — the most load-bearing proposal promises

For each claim below we state the **as-written promise**, what we
**actually verified**, and what remains to close.

### Claim 1 — "Ingestion via Galexie and the Composable Data Platform"

- **As written** (proposal §SDEX): "direct ledger processing…
  primary integration path is Galexie and the Stellar Composable
  Data Platform."
- **Verified**: Galexie's subcommand set, config, captive-core
  integration, filesystem-backend-drops-metadata bug, and zstd
  compression were read from `stellar-galexie` source. CDP SDK
  (`github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/ingest`) path confirmed via
  [data-sources/composable-data-platform.md](../discovery/data-sources/composable-data-platform.md).
- **Open**: MinIO + Galexie smoke test (Week 3). Captive-core +
  Galexie co-resident memory profile.
- **Verdict**: ✅ promise keeps.

### Claim 2 — "Reflector is the primary oracle integration"

- **As written** (proposal §Reflector): "Integration via direct
  Soroban contract calls using the SEP-40 interface: `lastprice(…)`,
  `prices(…)`, `twap(…)`, `x_last_price(…)`, `x_prices(…)`,
  `x_twap(…)`."
- **Verified**: Reflector exposes Pulse and Beam contracts with
  `base`, `assets`, `decimals`, `resolution`, `price`, `prices`,
  `lastprice` ([oracles/reflector.md](../discovery/oracles/reflector.md)).
  **`twap` and `x_*` do not exist on Reflector v3.** Event shape
  `["REFLECTOR","update"]` with `Vec<(Val,i128)>` payload verified.
- **Correction filed**: [proposal-corrections.md](../discovery/proposal-corrections.md) —
  we compute TWAP and cross-pair **locally** from Reflector's
  `lastprice`/`prices` output, not via on-chain calls.
- **Verdict**: ✅ promise keeps with the correction — functional
  equivalence is achieved, just in our aggregation layer.

### Claim 3 — "Redstone integration via per-symbol Soroban contracts"

- **As written** (proposal §Redstone): "`readPricesFromContract()`
  calls to the deployed per-symbol feed contracts, using
  `redstone_adapter` as the coordination point. Price data
  `{ price: U256, package_timestamp, write_timestamp }`."
- **Verified**: 19 mainnet feeds enumerated, all per-feed WASM hashes
  identical, `U256` field confirmed in
  `common/src/lib.rs` ([oracles/redstone.md](../discovery/oracles/redstone.md)).
  **Adapter emits events** (topic `"REDSTONE"`, one per batch push) —
  we can subscribe instead of polling.
- **Verdict**: ✅ promise keeps, event stream is a bonus.

### Claim 4 — "Band Protocol via BandChain REST API"

- **As written** (proposal §Band): "Integration will be via the
  BandChain REST API."
- **Verified**: **Band has a native Soroban StandardReference contract
  on mainnet today** — the proposal promise is unnecessarily
  degraded. Pair rate is E18-scaled
  ([oracles/band.md](../discovery/oracles/band.md)).
- **Correction filed**: [proposal-corrections.md](../discovery/proposal-corrections.md) —
  we integrate natively, not via BandChain REST.
- **Verdict**: ✅ we exceed the promise.

### Claim 5 — "Stellar DEX, Soroswap, Aquarius, Blend ingestion"

- **As written** (proposal §Soroban DEXs): list of venues with event
  decoding.
- **Verified**: 6 venues (SDEX, Soroswap, Aquarius, Phoenix, Comet,
  Blend) have full event-schema audits with mainnet addresses where
  available. Phoenix's 8-events-per-swap pattern and Soroswap's
  swap+sync correlation were non-obvious and are both captured
  explicitly.
- **Verdict**: ✅ promise exceeded (Phoenix + Comet added).

### Claim 6 — "p95 ≤ 200 ms, p99 ≤ 500 ms, ≥ 99.99% uptime"

- **As written** (proposal §Performance SLAs).
- **Verified**: nothing empirically. The pattern (precomputed
  aggregates in Redis + CDN-cacheable historical) is industry-
  standard but our capacity, cache-hit-rate, and cold-cache latency
  are unmeasured.
- **Closure**: [HA plan](ha-plan.md) + [API design](../reference/api-design.md) +
  Week 9 load-test.
- **Verdict**: 🧪 plan-credible; proof deferred to Week 9.

### Claim 7 — "Since-inception historical coverage"

- **As written** (proposal §Historical Data).
- **Verified**: Galexie can replay from ledger 2; SDF public GCS
  bucket is available as an accelerator
  ([data-sources/galexie.md](../discovery/data-sources/galexie.md) +
  [data-sources/stellar-data-lakes.md](../discovery/data-sources/stellar-data-lakes.md)).
  Backfill throughput unmeasured on our hardware.
- **Closure**: Week 5 runs the full backfill; the Week 9 load test
  validates query performance on the resulting data set.
- **Verdict**: ✅ promise is feasible; duration unknown.

### Claim 8 — "Open source, provider-supplied deployment kits"

- **As written** (proposal §Open Source & Deployment Model).
- **Verified**: Apache-2.0 LICENSE committed; `deploy/docker-compose`
  + `deploy/k8s` planned (Weeks 8–9).
- **Verdict**: 🧪 lifecycle on track.

## Gap triage — the "must-close-before-launch" list

Ranked by blast radius.

### Hard gaps (block launch)

1. **F3.5 / F3.6 SEV-1/SEV-2 runbook** — no runbook yet.
   Owner: Week 9. Deliverable: `docs/operations/sev-playbook.md`.
2. **S9.2 p95 ≤ 200 ms proof** — no load test yet.
   Owner: Week 9. Deliverable: `test/load/` + report.
3. **S6.5 / S7 Retention policy** — not in a migration yet.
   Owner: Week 4. Deliverable: `migrations/0001_timescale_hypertables.sql`
   + continuous-aggregate DDL.

### Soft gaps (block a V2 milestone, not V1 launch)

4. **F2.4 circulating-supply policy** — algorithm designed, policy
   choices (locked-set defaults) not ratified.
   Owner: Week 6. Deliverable: ADR-0011.
5. **F2.6 max_supply off-chain resolution** — SEP-1 path captured;
   the `[CURRENCIES] max_supply` field is not universally populated.
   Owner: Week 6. Deliverable: `internal/metadata/maxsupply` fallback
   policy doc.

### Watch (monitor during 10-week window)

6. **S2.5 DIA mainnet ship** — testnet only today.
7. **S9.1 99.99 % uptime** — need at least 30 days of production to
   measure. Accepted as post-launch SLA with a gradient: Week 10 we
   show a credible architecture, 90 days post-launch we show the
   number.
8. **S9.4 Degradation envelope** — `stale_flag`, `reduced_redundancy`
   are design-only. Spec to land in `openapi/rates-engine.v1.yaml`
   alongside each endpoint (Week 7).

## Verification protocol

Every row above marked `✅ verified` was verified by one of these
methods. If a reviewer disputes a cell, re-run the listed verification
step.

| Method | How |
| ------ | --- |
| **Source read** | Cloned the repo into `.discovery-repos/`, opened the file, verified the claim against the code. File path cited in the linked discovery doc. |
| **Protocol spec read** | Read the SEP / CAP markdown in `stellar-protocol/`. Section cited in the linked discovery doc. |
| **On-chain verification** | Queried stellar.expert's public API or a direct RPC call against mainnet. Contract + WASM hash recorded. |
| **Test** | Go test in `internal/*_test.go` exercises the claim with a fixture. KALIEN i128 regression in `internal/canonical/amount_test.go` is the canonical example. |
| **External doc (weaker)** | WebFetch of an SDF / project-maintained reference doc. Only acceptable where the doc itself is primary (e.g. `stellar-docs/networks/software-versions.mdx`). |

Rows marked `🧪 designed` are pattern-credible but not exercised end
to end. They are expected to convert to `✅ verified` as the owner
week lands.
