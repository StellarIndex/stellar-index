# RFP × Proposal × Delivery Coverage Matrix

**Ratified:** 2026-04-22.
**Re-baselined:** 2026-04-30 — every row in this matrix has been
cross-referenced against the current code. The audit's
docs/audit-2026-04-29/ workspace flagged drift in both directions
(rows marked "designed" that had shipped, rows marked "verified"
that had regressed in production wiring); this re-baseline rewrites
those rows to the as-of-2026-04-30 reality. A separate Codex pass
against the RFPs + proposal also surfaced specific contract gaps
(Blend, Chainlink, Freighter V2 wiring) that are now reflected in
each row's Status / Conf.

**Purpose:** one authoritative table mapping every contractual requirement
to the mechanism that satisfies it. Supersedes the narrower
`docs/discovery/rfp-requirements-matrix.md` (which remains valid as
the source-discovery artefact).

## How to read this doc

Each row captures **one atomic requirement** from either RFP, sourced
verbatim from:

- [docs/stellar-rfp.md](../stellar-rfp.md) — Stellar Prices API RFP.
- [docs/freighter-rfp.md](../freighter-rfp.md) — Freighter asset-detail RFP.

For each row:

| Column | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| **Requirement** | Verbatim or close paraphrase of the RFP bullet. |
| **Proposal commitment** | Where our `docs/ctx-proposal.md` commits to it. |
| **Delivery week** | Which week in [docs/discovery/delivery-plan.md](../discovery/delivery-plan.md) implements it. |
| **Owner binary / package** | The Go `cmd/*` or `internal/*` that delivers it. |
| **ADR** | The architectural decision that binds the implementation. |
| **Verified by** | The discovery doc whose primary-source work proves feasibility. |
| **Status** | `✅ verified`, `🧪 designed, impl pending`, `⏳ deferred`, `⚠ caveat`, `❌ gap`. |
| **Confidence** | Honest 1–5 score: 5 = code+tests, 1 = hand-wave. |

Any row with **status ❌** is a blocker for launch. Any row with
**confidence ≤ 2** is a risk line in the Week-N review.

## Freighter RFP — V1: Historical price chart

Same as S7. No additional requirement.

> **Scope note (chart `price_type=twap`).** `/v1/chart` accepts
> `price_type=vwap` today and rejects `price_type=twap` with a
> 400 Bad Request per ADR-0020. TWAP is reserved, not delivered:
> the on-the-fly TWAP we'd compute from the 1m CAGG would
> produce different values from a future TWAP CAGG (pre-/post-
> shape difference) and create a one-time consumer-visible
> shift, so we'd rather defer than ship-and-rotate. `/v1/twap`
> single-bar TWAP is shipped (Go-side time-weighted compute from
> raw trades) — only the multi-bucket chart variant is the
> reserved item.

## Freighter RFP — V2: Market data extension

> **Scope note.** F2.1 / F2.2 / F2.4 / F2.5 supply pipelines are
> live for **operator-watched assets** (XLM is always-on; classic
> credit assets and SEP-41 tokens via `[supply].watched_classic_assets`
> and `[supply].watched_sep41_contracts` per ADR-0022 and ADR-0023).
> Per-asset opt-in is by design: classic credit issuers and SEP-41
> tokens carry decentralised mint authorities and the
> "is this issuer's supply meaningful at this scale" judgment is
> operator-curated, not blanket. The API returns nullable supply
> fields cleanly when an asset is outside the watched set
> (matches ADR-0011 "we don't fabricate"). Operator can widen
> coverage via TOML config without code change.

Classic + XLM totals via the same algorithm-correct path. | 4 |

Per ADR-0011, `max_supply` stays null for uncapped issuers without SEP-1 declaration / operator override; consumers handle null explicitly. | 4 |

## Claim verification — the most load-bearing proposal promises

For each claim below we state the **as-written promise**, what we
**actually verified**, and what remains to close.

### Claim 1 — "Ingestion via Galexie and the Composable Data Platform"

- **As written** (proposal §SDEX): "direct ledger processing…
  primary integration path is Galexie and the Stellar Composable
  Data Platform."
- **Verified**: Galexie's subcommand set, config, captive-core
  integration, filesystem-backend-drops-metadata bug, and zstd
  compression were read from `stellar-galexie` source. CDP SDK
  (`github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk/ingest`) path confirmed via
  [data-sources/composable-data-platform.md](../discovery/data-sources/composable-data-platform.md).
- **Open**: MinIO + Galexie smoke test (Week 3). Captive-core +
  Galexie co-resident memory profile.
- **Verdict**: ✅ promise keeps.

### Claim 2 — "Reflector is the primary oracle integration"

- **As written** (proposal §Reflector): "Integration via direct
  Soroban contract calls using the SEP-40 interface: `lastprice(…)`,
  `prices(…)`, `twap(…)`, `x_last_price(…)`, `x_prices(…)`,
  `x_twap(…)`."
- **Verified**: Reflector exposes Pulse and Beam contracts with
  `base`, `assets`, `decimals`, `resolution`, `price`, `prices`,
  `lastprice` ([oracles/reflector.md](../discovery/oracles/reflector.md)).
  **`twap` and `x_*` do not exist on Reflector v3.** Event shape
  `["REFLECTOR","update"]` with `Vec<(Val,i128)>` payload verified.
- **Correction filed**: [proposal-corrections.md](../discovery/proposal-corrections.md) —
  we compute TWAP and cross-pair **locally** from Reflector's
  `lastprice`/`prices` output, not via on-chain calls.
- **Verdict**: ✅ promise keeps with the correction — functional
  equivalence is achieved, just in our aggregation layer.

### Claim 3 — "Redstone integration via per-symbol Soroban contracts"

- **As written** (proposal §Redstone): "`readPricesFromContract()`
  calls to the deployed per-symbol feed contracts, using
  `redstone_adapter` as the coordination point. Price data
  `{ price: U256, package_timestamp, write_timestamp }`."
- **Verified**: 19 mainnet feeds enumerated, all per-feed WASM hashes
  identical, `U256` field confirmed in
  `common/src/lib.rs` ([oracles/redstone.md](../discovery/oracles/redstone.md)).
  **Adapter emits events** (topic `"REDSTONE"`, one per batch push) —
  we can subscribe instead of polling.
- **Verdict**: ✅ promise keeps, event stream is a bonus.

### Claim 4 — "Band Protocol via BandChain REST API"

- **As written** (proposal §Band): "Integration will be via the
  BandChain REST API."
- **Verified**: **Band has a native Soroban StandardReference contract
  on mainnet today** — the proposal promise is unnecessarily
  degraded. Pair rate is E18-scaled
  ([oracles/band.md](../discovery/oracles/band.md)).
- **Correction filed**: [proposal-corrections.md](../discovery/proposal-corrections.md) —
  we integrate natively, not via BandChain REST.
- **Verdict**: ✅ we exceed the promise.

### Claim 5 — "Stellar DEX, Soroswap, Aquarius, Blend ingestion"

- **As written** (proposal §Soroban DEXs): list of venues with event
  decoding.
- **Verified**: current repo snapshot ships **6 venues** (SDEX,
  Soroswap, Aquarius, Phoenix, Comet, **Blend**). Blend's auction
  decoder + storage + dispatcher wiring is live (`internal/sources/blend/`,
  registered in `internal/pipeline/dispatcher.go:114`,
  `internal/pipeline/sink.go:98`). What's still
  pending on Blend is the WASM audit's Phase 2 — per-pool
  `wasm-history` walk on r1 — which keeps `BackfillSafe=false` in
  `internal/sources/external/registry.go` until it lands. Live
  ingest works fine; only retroactive backfill replay is gated.
  Phoenix's 8-events-per-swap pattern and Soroswap's swap+sync
  correlation were non-obvious and are both captured explicitly.
- **Verdict**: ✅ promise exceeded in venue breadth (Phoenix +
  Comet added beyond the proposal's list); Blend live with the
  documented backfill caveat from the WASM audit.

### Claim 6 — "p95 ≤ 200 ms, p99 ≤ 500 ms, ≥ 99.99% uptime"

- **As written** (proposal §Performance SLAs).
- **Verified**: nothing empirically. The pattern (precomputed
  aggregates in Redis + CDN-cacheable historical) is industry-
  standard but our capacity, cache-hit-rate, and cold-cache latency
  are unmeasured.
- **Closure**: [HA plan](ha-plan.md) + [API design](../reference/api-design.md) +
  Week 9 load-test.
- **Verdict**: 🧪 plan-credible; proof deferred to Week 9.

### Claim 7 — "Since-inception historical coverage"

- **As written** (proposal §Historical Data).
- **Verified**: Galexie can replay from ledger 2; SDF public GCS
  bucket is available as an accelerator
  ([data-sources/galexie.md](../discovery/data-sources/galexie.md) +
  [data-sources/stellar-data-lakes.md](../discovery/data-sources/stellar-data-lakes.md)).
  Backfill throughput unmeasured on our hardware.
- **Closure**: Week 5 runs the full backfill; the Week 9 load test
  validates query performance on the resulting data set.
- **Verdict**: ✅ promise is feasible; duration unknown.

### Claim 8 — "Open source, provider-supplied deployment kits"

- **As written** (proposal §Open Source & Deployment Model).
- **Verified**: Apache-2.0 LICENSE committed; `deploy/docker-compose`
  + `deploy/k8s` planned (Weeks 8–9).
- **Verdict**: 🧪 lifecycle on track.

## Gap triage — the "must-close-before-launch" list

**Operator decision 2026-04-28: every outstanding item is
launch-blocking.** No "soft gap" / "post-launch" deferrals
beyond items explicitly marked ⏳ (DIA mainnet, 99.99% production
measurement, Phase 3 cross-oracle).

Ranked by remaining work, not blast radius. See
[`docs/architecture/launch-readiness-backlog.md`](launch-readiness-backlog.md)
for the canonical work list with effort estimates and dependencies.

### Closed since Phase 1

**Phase 1-era closures (matrix-ratification 2026-04-22):**

- **F1.6 SEP-1 home-domain resolution** — was open gap; landed in
  PR #192 (overlay handler) + PR #190 scaffolding.
- **S6.5 / S7 Retention policy** — was hard gap; landed in
  `migrations/0002_create_price_aggregates.up.sql`.
- **F3.5 / F3.6 SEV runbooks** — was hard gap; sev-playbook.md
  shipped 2026-04-22, individual runbooks growing per
  alerts-catalog.md.
- **F2.4 circulating-supply policy** — was open; ratified in
  ADR-0011 2026-04-27.
- **X1.1 / X1.3 Archive completeness bootstrap** — added post-Phase-1
  per ADR-0017; bootstrapped on R1 2026-04-28.

**Implementation closures (verified 2026-04-30 against current
code state — these were on the "Open" list but had shipped):**

- **S4.1–S4.4 VWAP/TWAP impl + USD volume + thresholds** —
  `internal/aggregate/{vwap,twap,ohlc,orchestrator}.go` shipped
  with `prices_*` CAGGs backing the API.
- **S8.1–S8.2 USD volume column + FX anchor** —
  `internal/aggregate/{triangulate,stablecoin}.go` + the
  `volume_usd` column in `trades` hypertable.
- **F2.4 circulating-supply impl** — three-domain split (XLM /
  classic / SEP-41) shipped through Tasks #54-#57; aggregator
  refresher wired.
- **S3.7 CEX connectors (Binance / Coinbase / Kraken / Bitstamp)** —
  all four in `internal/sources/external/` with
  `BackfillSafe: true`.
- **S2.4 Chainlink HTTP cross-check** — `ChainlinkReference`
  shipped in #282; live in `internal/divergence/chainlink.go`.
- **S1.4 Asset enumeration / discovery** —
  `internal/canonical/discovery/` package live with sniffer +
  recorder.
- **X2.2 `/v1/price/tip` + last-good-price fallback** —
  `internal/api/v1/price_tip.go` (302 LoC) + stream variant.
- **X2.3 `/v1/observations` per-source raw** —
  `internal/api/v1/observations.go` (205 LoC) + stream variant.
- **X2.6 Streaming endpoints (×4)** — `/v1/price/stream`,
  `/v1/price/tip/stream`, `/v1/observations/stream`,
  `/v1/chart`. All four shipped under `internal/api/v1/`.
- **X3.1 Phase 1 anomaly thresholds** —
  `internal/aggregate/anomaly/` package live.
- **X3.2–X3.7 Phase 2 statistical baseline + freeze** —
  `internal/aggregate/{baseline,confidence,freeze}/` packages
  shipped (3,474 LoC including tests). Multi-window baseline
  columns landed in `migrations/0008_add_multi_window_baseline.up.sql`.
- **F5.3 Batch / bulk-query endpoint** — `/v1/price/batch`
  handler in `internal/api/v1/price.go` + `price_batch_test.go`.
- **#2 SEP-10 protocol implementation** —

  pipeline live; HTML regenerated per OpenAPI change (drift
  detected by CI's `openapi lint` job).
- **#24 `internal/divergence/` package** — chainlink + coingecko
  + compare + worker + reference all shipped.
- **X1.5 archive-completeness daemon** — `cmd/ratesengine-ops`
  has full set of subcommands: `backfill`, `cross-region-check`,
  `cross-region-monitor`, `discovery`, `hubble-check`,
  `hubble-soroban-events`.
- **X1.7 verify-archive `-fail-on-missed`** — flag exists in
  `cmd/ratesengine-ops/main.go`.
- **#21 CHANGELOG + SemVer policy** — `CHANGELOG.md` +
  `docs/architecture/semver-policy.md` shipped.
- **#23 Release-notes template** — `.github/RELEASE_NOTES_TEMPLATE.md`.
- **#26 Envelope flag retrofit** — `internal/api/v1/envelope.go`
  exposes `stale`, `reduced_redundancy`, `triangulated`,
  `divergence_warning` flags (S5.4 verified).

  scaffold + 7 scenarios (price/vwap-twap/history/batch/stream/
  mixed-realistic/spike) + AlertManager-silence integration +
  weekly GitHub Actions schedule shipped via PRs #345/#346/#347/
  #348. Companion design note at
  `docs/architecture/k6-load-tests-design-note.md`. The remaining
  S9.2 work is the operator-side first end-to-end run against
  staging and the `sla-proof-2026-MM-DD.md` artefact (Task #77).
- **Patroni ansible role (Task #72 launch-critical sub-role)** —
  shipped via PR #344. Implements the topology pinned in
  `ha-plan §3.3` (1 primary + 2 sync replicas, 3-node etcd
  quorum). Companion design note at
  `docs/architecture/patroni-ansible-role-design-note.md`. Other
  sub-roles (Redis Sentinel, HAProxy, Prometheus, Loki) remain
  open under Task #72.

### Open — implementation pending

Re-baselined 2026-04-30 against current code state. Twenty-one
items previously listed here have shipped — their evidence is
now in *Closed since Phase 1* above.

| Area | Item | Owner | Week | Effort |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Aggregator | X2.5 Forex factor snap rule for chained-fiat | `internal/aggregate/triangulate` | 5 | half-day |
| Operations | #11–#16 Ansible roles — Patroni shipped (#344); Redis Sentinel (design draft local) / HAProxy / Prometheus / Loki remaining | `configs/ansible/roles/` | 8 | ~3 days |
| Operations | Public status page at `status.ratesengine.net` | infra | 9 | half-day |
| Validation | S9.2 p95 ≤ 200 ms proof report — k6 suite shipped (#345/#346/#347/#348); operator-side first run + `sla-proof-2026-MM-DD.md` artefact remaining | `docs/operations/sla-proof-template.md` | 9 | ~half-day operator |
| Validation | #19 Chaos suite — `test/chaos/` not yet created | `test/chaos` | 9 | full day |
| Validation | #20 SEV-1/SEV-2 dry-run — playbook exists, dry-run record doesn't | runbooks | 9 | half-day |
| Finalization | #22 Public-flip prep — `public-flip.md` exists; checklist completion is operator-side | repo strategy | 10 | hour planning |
| Connectors / Audit | Task #53 Blend Pool Factory walk on r1 (Phase 2 of audit) | `cmd/ratesengine-ops wasm-history` | — | ~5 h operator |

### Watch (post-launch only — explicitly accepted)

1. **S2.5 DIA mainnet ship** — testnet only today; integration
   conditional on DIA's mainnet launch.
2. **S9.1 99.99 % uptime measurement** — needs ≥30 days production
   to measure. Architecture credible at launch; number reported
   90 days post-launch.
3. **X3.5 Phase 3 cross-oracle factor** — depends on
   `internal/divergence/` shipping; nominal post-launch unless
   schedule allows pulling it forward.

## Verification protocol

Every row above marked `✅ verified` was verified by one of these
methods. If a reviewer disputes a cell, re-run the listed verification
step.

| Method | How |
| ------ | --- |
| **Source read** | Cloned the repo into `.discovery-repos/`, opened the file, verified the claim against the code. File path cited in the linked discovery doc. |
| **Protocol spec read** | Read the SEP / CAP markdown in `stellar-protocol/`. Section cited in the linked discovery doc. |
| **On-chain verification** | Queried stellar.expert's public API or a direct RPC call against mainnet. Contract + WASM hash recorded. |
| **Test** | Go test in `internal/*_test.go` exercises the claim with a fixture. KALIEN i128 regression in `internal/canonical/amount_test.go` is the canonical example. |
| **External doc (weaker)** | WebFetch of an SDF / project-maintained reference doc. Only acceptable where the doc itself is primary (e.g. `stellar-docs/networks/software-versions.mdx`). |

Rows marked `🧪 designed` are pattern-credible but not exercised end
to end. They are expected to convert to `✅ verified` as the owner
week lands.

  section (X1 archive completeness from ADR-0017, X2 API consistency
  surfaces from ADR-0018, X3 anomaly response from ADR-0019).
  Refreshed gap-triage to reflect operator decision that all
  outstanding items are launch-blocking; closed F1.6, S6.5/S7,
  F3.5/F3.6, F2.4 against shipped work; canonical backlog moved to
  `launch-readiness-backlog.md`.
