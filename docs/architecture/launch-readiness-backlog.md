# Launch readiness backlog

The canonical list of outstanding implementation work between
today and launch. Sourced from:

- [`coverage-matrix.md`](coverage-matrix.md) — RFP × ADR × code
  traceability with status per requirement
- [`docs/discovery/delivery-plan.md`](../discovery/delivery-plan.md) —
  the original 10-week calendar
- ADRs 0017, 0018, 0019 — cross-cutting integrity invariants
  added post-Phase-1
- This session's design discussions (oracle manipulation,
  consistency surfaces, anomaly response)

**Operator decision 2026-04-28: every outstanding item is
launch-blocking.** Items explicitly marked `⏳ post-launch` are the
only deferrals (DIA mainnet, 99.99% uptime measurement, ADR-0019
Phase 3 cross-oracle factor). Everything else ships before
production cutover.

## How to read this doc

- **Phase** — when the item lands relative to the original delivery plan
- **Effort** — engineering days (calendar-time estimate, single owner)
- **Depends on** — prerequisite items by ID
- **Blocks** — what cannot ship without this
- **Owner** — Go package or deployment area
- **Status** — `🟢 in flight` | `🟡 designed, ready to start` | `🔴 not started` | `✅ shipped` | `⏳ post-launch`

Items are grouped by surface (ingest / aggregator / API / ops / validation / finalization).
Within each surface, ordered by dependency.

## Post-launch (explicitly deferred)

| ID | Item | Justification | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| L7.1 | DIA mainnet integration | Conditional on DIA shipping mainnet | ⏳ |
| L7.2 | 99.99% uptime measurement | Needs ≥ 30 days production data; reported 90 days post-launch | ⏳ |
| L7.3 | ADR-0019 Phase 3 cross-oracle factor | Depends on L2.10 (`internal/divergence/`) being production-quality first | ⏳ |
| L7.4 | Tier-1 own-validator deployment (per ADR-0004) | Multi-week catchup; not required for V1 launch | ⏳ |
| L7.5 | GraphQL surface alongside REST | Optional per RFP; defer until customer-driven | ⏳ |

```

**Critical-path long-pole:** L2.5 → L2.6 → L2.7 (statistical
baselines + confidence + freeze) is ~1.5 weeks of focused work
and gates L3.1 (the API actually serving rates).

**Parallelisable:** ingest connectors (L1.*), supply package (L2.12),
divergence package (L2.10), SDK (L3.10), ansible roles (L4.1–L4.5)
all run in parallel with the aggregator critical path.

## What "launch-blocking" actually means

Per operator decision 2026-04-28, all 🔴 / 🟡 items above ship
before production cutover. Two consequences:

1. **The 10-week original plan slips by ~1–2 weeks.** The pre-Phase-1
   estimate didn't account for ADR-0017/0018/0019's added scope or
   for the ~1.5 weeks of confidence-scoring work in L2.5–L2.7.
   Realistic launch window: late July 2026 (vs original June 30).
2. **No "soft launch" with stub responses.** Every endpoint serves
   real, anomaly-protected data on day 1. Customers who tested
   against staging see the same wire shape and behaviour at
   production cutover.

The deferrals in the post-launch table above are the only carve-outs;
each has a justification that the operator has explicitly accepted.

## Maintenance

This doc is the **canonical** backlog. Update protocol:

- When an item ships: change status to ✅ and add a one-line note
  with the PR number(s)
- When a new item emerges (from an incident, new ADR, or scope
  decision): add a row in the appropriate surface, with full
  dependency / effort / owner fields
- When phase boundaries shift: update the Phase column (don't
  delete the original assignment — track the slip explicitly)
- Review cadence: end of every week, alongside the Friday status
  update. Failure to update means the doc is stale; treat that as a
  CI failure for the next week's planning.

The matching change log lives at the bottom of
[`coverage-matrix.md`](coverage-matrix.md) (the requirements layer);
this doc tracks the implementation layer.
