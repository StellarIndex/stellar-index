# Database migrations

TimescaleDB / PostgreSQL schema migrations, `golang-migrate` format.

Numbering is four-digit sequential. Each migration has a matching
`up.sql` / `down.sql` pair. `down.sql` must fully reverse `up.sql`
where possible; for irreversible operations (e.g. dropping a
hypertable chunk), the `down.sql` contains a comment explaining the
asymmetry.

## Running

Through the `ratesengine-migrate` binary (preferred):

```sh
make db-migrate-status    # what's applied
make db-migrate-up        # apply everything pending
make db-migrate-down      # roll back one
```

Direct via `golang-migrate` CLI:

```sh
migrate -path migrations -database "${RATESENGINE_POSTGRES_DSN}" up
migrate -path migrations -database "${RATESENGINE_POSTGRES_DSN}" down 1
```

## Rules

1. **Never edit a migration that has run in production** (this
   includes staging). Add a new migration instead.
2. **Numbering must be dense** — no gaps, no duplicates.
3. **Changes to TimescaleDB features** (hypertables, compression,
   continuous aggregates) must be done with the extension's API
   (`create_hypertable`, `add_compression_policy`,
   `refresh_continuous_aggregate`) — not by touching the internal
   `_timescaledb_*` schemas directly.
4. **Every migration that creates a continuous aggregate** also adds
   its refresh policy + retention policy in the same file. A CAGG
   without a refresh policy is a silent bug.
5. **Amounts are always `NUMERIC`** (arbitrary precision). Never
   `bigint` — breaks i128 per ADR-0003.
6. **IDs follow canonical wire form** as text: `<code>-<issuer>` for
   classic, `C…` for Soroban, `native` for XLM. See
   `internal/canonical/asset.go`.

## Conventions

- Statement terminators on their own line; always semicolon-end.
- `CREATE … IF NOT EXISTS` where idempotent; otherwise plain `CREATE`
  so a rerun after manual poking fails loudly.
- Comments above the statement (not inline) and explain the *why*.
- Timestamp columns are `timestamptz`, stored + served in UTC.
- Transactions: each migration runs in its own transaction by default
  (golang-migrate); disable with `-- migrate:no-transaction` when
  creating a hypertable on a very large existing table.
