-- 0002 up — continuous aggregates + refresh + retention.
--
-- Implements the grain set named in the Freighter RFP's historical-
-- price table: 1m / 15m / 1h / 4h / 1d / 1w / 1mo. Each CAGG is a
-- VWAP (volume-weighted) + TWAP (time-weighted) pre-computation
-- that the /v1/history endpoint queries directly.
--
-- Retention:
--   - sub-hourly grains (1m, 15m) retained 30 days.
--   - hourly+ grains (1h, 4h, 1d, 1w, 1mo) retained INDEFINITELY
--     — matches the RFP commitment for the all-time view.
--
-- Refresh policy:
--   Each CAGG refreshes its "recent" slice on a cadence shorter than
--   its own grain. Coarser grains refresh less often.
--
-- Column semantics per grain row:
--   bucket           = start of the aggregation window (timestamptz)
--   base_asset       = canonical base
--   quote_asset      = canonical quote
--   vwap             = Σ(price × v) / Σ(v) — volume-weighted
--   twap             = Σ(price) / N       — time-weighted (equal-weight)
--   volume           = Σ(base_amount)     — base-asset volume in window
--   volume_usd       = Σ(usd_volume)      — USD-denominated volume
--   trade_count      = N                  — trades contributing
--   sources          = distinct source list that contributed
--   first_price      = price of earliest trade  → OHLC `open`
--   last_price       = price of latest trade    → OHLC `close`
--   high_price       = max price                → OHLC `high`
--   low_price        = min price                → OHLC `low`
