# r1-smoke.sh — exercise the launch-critical API surface against
# a deployment. Defaults to R1 over its internal address; pass
# API_BASE_URL to point elsewhere (e.g. http://localhost:3000 in
# dev or https://api.ratesengine.net post-DNS-cutover).
#
# Each check runs independently — one failing endpoint doesn't
# short-circuit the others, so a single run reports every break.
# Exit code is the number of failed checks.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/dev/r1-smoke.sh                       # public defaults
#   API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 bash scripts/dev/r1-smoke.sh
#   ssh root@136.243.90.96 'bash -s' < scripts/dev/r1-smoke.sh
#
# Designed to be safe to run from cron / a healthcheck timer:
# every endpoint is GET, response bodies are truncated, no auth
# is required (anonymous tier covers everything checked).
#
# Two flavours of check:
#   - check NAME PATH [-- jq-test]                  — wants HTTP 200
#   - expect_status STATUS NAME PATH [-- jq-test]  — wants any status
# Use expect_status for *behaviour pins* — asserting documented 4xx
# responses (e.g. invalid-cursor, invalid-limit, coin-not-found) so
# a regression that flips a documented 400 back to a silent 200
# (the class of bug that motivated #1134) fails the smoke instead
# of sailing past liveness checks.
