# r1-smoke.sh — exercise the launch-critical API surface against
# a deployment. Defaults to R1 over its internal address; pass
# API_BASE_URL to point elsewhere (e.g. http://localhost:3000 in
# dev or https://api.ratesengine.net post-DNS-cutover).
#
# Each check runs independently — one failing endpoint doesn't
# short-circuit the others, so a single run reports every break.
# Exit code is the number of failed checks.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/dev/r1-smoke.sh                       # public defaults
#   API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 bash scripts/dev/r1-smoke.sh
#   ssh root@136.243.90.96 'bash -s' < scripts/dev/r1-smoke.sh
#
# Designed to be safe to run from cron / a healthcheck timer:
# every endpoint is GET, response bodies are truncated, no auth
# is required (anonymous tier covers everything checked).
#
# Two flavours of check:
#   - check NAME PATH [-- jq-test]                  — wants HTTP 200
#   - expect_status STATUS NAME PATH [-- jq-test]  — wants any status
# Use expect_status for *behaviour pins* — asserting documented 4xx
# responses (e.g. invalid-cursor, invalid-limit, coin-not-found) so
# a regression that flips a documented 400 back to a silent 200
# (the class of bug that motivated #1134) fails the smoke instead
# of sailing past liveness checks.

# expect_status STATUS NAME PATH [-- jq-test]
#
# Variant of [check] that asserts an arbitrary HTTP status. Used for
# negative checks like:
#
#   expect_status 400 "coins bad cursor" "/v1/coins?cursor=garbage" \
#     -- '.type | endswith("/invalid-cursor")'
#
# STATUS may be a single code (`200`) OR a `|`-separated set of
# acceptable codes (`"200|404"`) — the latter for routes whose 4xx
# is data-dependent (e.g. /v1/ohlc returns 404 errors/no-trades when
# the test pair has no recent trades; /v1/oracle/prices returns
# 404 when no oracle has reported for the asset in the window).
# Dual-status acceptance lets the smoke still catch a 5xx regression
# without false-failing on documented-empty windows (F-0156).
#
# The jq-test runs against the response body — useful for asserting
# the problem+json error type, not just "some 4xx". Behavioural
# pinning catches regressions that flip a documented 400 into a
# silent 200-with-empty-body (the class of bug that motivated this
# helper — see #1134 / #1135 for context). When STATUS is multi-
# valued, the jq-test runs against whatever body came back — keep
# it generic ('.type? != null') or omit it for those checks.
