#   2. Replace the converter's collection-level `noauth` with bearer
#      auth bound to a {{bearerToken}} collection variable. The
#      OpenAPI global security is `[{}, APIKeyAuth]` (anonymous
#      allowed), which the converter renders as noauth — shipping
#      the collection un-authable. Requests inherit collection auth
#      in Postman, so binding it here means "paste your key into the
#      bearerToken variable" is the only setup step; anonymous use
#      still works because the server accepts keyless requests on
#      public endpoints (empty token → empty header value).
