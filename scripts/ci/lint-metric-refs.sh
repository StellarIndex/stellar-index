# lint-metric-refs.sh — F-1329 guard against the "dead alert layer".
#
# Every `stellarindex_*` metric token referenced inside a Prometheus
# rule `expr:` MUST resolve to something that actually emits it — a
# `Name:` field in internal/obs (or any literal use in internal/ cmd/
# scripts/ configs/healthchecks, which covers textfile-collector .prom
# emitters too). A rule that selects a metric nothing produces is dead:
# it can never fire, so the operator gets a false sense of coverage.
# That is exactly how backups could silently stop with zero paging
# (the F-1329 finding).
#
# Scope + conservatism:
#   - Only `stellarindex_*` tokens are enforced. node_/pg_/redis_/
#     pgbackrest_ metrics come from third-party exporters whose full
#     metric set isn't in this repo, so enforcing them would be all
#     false positives. They're handled by promtool + the EXTERNAL_OK
#     reference list below (documentation only).
#   - Tokens that appear ONLY inside a `job=` / `job=~` matcher are
#     ignored — those are scrape-job names (e.g. stellarindex_indexer in
#     the multi-host config), not metric names.
#   - Recording-rule outputs use the `stellarindex:foo:5m` colon style,
#     which never matches the `stellarindex_[a-z0-9_]+` token regex.
#   - KNOWN_INERT lists references that are deliberately kept but cannot
#     fire (no producer exists yet / not applicable on this host). Each
#     entry is documented with an INERT comment in the rule file. Adding
#     a producer = remove the entry. Inventing a metric name that still
#     has no producer is NOT allowed: it would just move from "dead" to
#     "dead AND lying about being live".
#
# Exit code = number of un-accounted-for dead references (0 = clean).
