# CLAUDE.md — repo orientation for AI agents

If you are an AI agent (Claude, any other assistant) opening this
repo cold, **this file is your entry point**. Read this first.

## What this repo is

**Stellar Index** is a **protocol explorer for the Stellar network**:
complete, verified, per-protocol on-chain data — every contract, event,
and trade for every major Stellar protocol — captured from a certified
raw ledger lake (ADR-0034), verified for completeness (ADR-0033), and
attributed by contract identity (ADR-0035; per-protocol verification
pages live in docs/protocols/). Long-term it grows into a comprehensive
Stellar explorer (classic/native + Soroban) — not a multi-chain explorer;
the cross-chain asset model (R-018) was removed in the Stellar-focus
refactor (docs/architecture/stellar-focus-refactor-plan.md).

Its flagship product is the **pricing API**: it ingests on-chain and
off-chain price data, aggregates into VWAP / TWAP / OHLC, and serves
the result through a public REST + SSE API.

The repo is Go (primary), Apache-2.0, pre-v1 at time of writing.

## Build + test commands

```sh
make help              # list all targets
make dev               # docker-compose up the local dependency stack (TimescaleDB + Redis + MinIO); the app binaries run on the host, and there is no API/ClickHouse service in the compose file
make test              # unit tests (fast; ~2 min)
make test-integration  # integration tests — spins its own containers via testcontainers-go (requires Docker)
make lint              # golangci-lint (gofumpt runs as a golangci formatter; architectural import boundaries enforced by scripts/ci/lint-imports.sh)
make build             # all binaries into bin/
make docs-all          # regenerate docs/reference/ from OpenAPI + struct tags + obs/*.go metric Name: fields
make verify            # canonical pre-push gate (fmt, vet, lint, docs, vuln, test) — run this before every push
```

For verifying a live deployment (R1 or local), use:

```sh
bash scripts/dev/r1-smoke.sh                       # localhost:3000 by default
API_BASE_URL=http://r1:3000 bash scripts/dev/r1-smoke.sh
```

13 GETs across health / catalogue / pricing / diagnostics with jq
shape assertions; exit code = number of failures so cron and
Healthchecks.io can consume it. R1 runs the same script every 5
min via `stellarindex-smoke.timer` (see `configs/healthchecks/`).

No command should ever require manual network access during
development. If one does, it's a bug.

## Invariants — never violate these

These are the architectural commitments binding every PR. See
[docs/adr/](docs/adr/) for the long-form rationale per ADR.

### 1. i128 / u128 never truncates to int64 (ADR-0003)

Token amounts, reserves, prices, supplies from Soroban are always:

- `*big.Int` in Go.
- `NUMERIC` column in Postgres / TimescaleDB.
- Strings in JSON (JSON numbers are IEEE 754 doubles — precision
  loss above 2^53).

Parsing `xdr.Int128Parts` to `int64(parts.Lo)` is a bug we will
find and reject in review every single time.

### 2. Horizon is not in our architecture (ADR-0001)

We don't run Horizon. We don't ingest from Horizon. We don't proxy
to Horizon. If a third-party protocol's only path to us is via
Horizon, we do not integrate it.

### 3. Self-hosted storage is S3-compatible — not local filesystem (ADR-0002)

Galexie's local filesystem backend silently drops per-object
metadata + has explicit multi-process-write warnings in its own
docstring. MinIO is our colo default; any S3-compatible service
works via `endpoint_url` override.

### 4. One Go module, monorepo (ADR-0005)

`github.com/StellarIndex/stellar-index` is the root module. `internal/` is
private (Go-enforced). `pkg/` is the public surface with SemVer
compatibility promise.

### 5. Tier-1 three-validator aspiration (ADR-0004)

Post-launch we run three geographically-separated full validators
with independent history archives. Validator keys live in an HSM;
never on disk unencrypted.

### 6. Ingest goes via Galexie → dispatcher → decoder. Never stellar-rpc.

**Production ingest:** `Galexie MinIO → internal/ledgerstream →
internal/dispatcher → internal/sources/<venue>/decode`. Decoders are
pure functions; no RPC client, no pagination loop, no per-source
goroutine. stellar-rpc was removed from r1 on 2026-04-23; it exists
only for the `rpc-probe` operator diagnostic and for capturing test
fixtures via `scripts/dev/`. Any new source that adds a
`rpc *stellarrpc.Client` field or a `BackfillRange` / `StreamLive`
method is wrong.

Full picture + binding rules: [docs/architecture/ingest-pipeline.md](docs/architecture/ingest-pipeline.md).

### 7. One writer per data domain (ADR-0031 + ADR-0032)

**Soroban-derived events** (`trades`, `blend_*`, `phoenix_*`,
`comet_*`, `soroswap_skim`, `cctp_events`, `rozo_events`,
`defindex_*`, `sep41_*`, `reflector`/`redstone` `oracle_updates`)
are written by **`internal/projector`** — and ONLY by the projector — from
the `soroban_events` raw landing zone (ADR-0029). Adding a new
Soroban source means adding a case in
`internal/projector/registry.go::buildSource` AND an arm in
`internal/pipeline/sink.go::IsProjectedEvent`. Catch-up after a
missing window is `stellarindex-ops projector-replay -source <name>
-from <ledger>` — never a bespoke `<source>-backfill` subcommand
(those were deleted in rc.97 / ADR-0032 Phase 5).

**Non-projected events** (`sdex`, external CEX/FX, `band`,
`soroswap_router` (ContractCall-derived, log-only — excluded from
`IsProjectedEvent`), supply observers) continue writing through the
dispatcher's events goroutine — they don't flow through
`soroban_events` and have their own catch-up paths.

**Coverage signal** is data-derived, not cursor-derived (ADR-0031):
cursor-derived helpers under `internal/api/v1` were deleted in
rc.93/94. The authoritative coverage VERDICT is `completeness_snapshots`
(ADR-0033: substrate + recognition + projection reconcile against the
ClickHouse lake); the gap-detector's `source_coverage_snapshots` is a
supporting signal.

### 8. ClickHouse is the raw lake; Postgres is the served tier (ADR-0034)

The certified raw history of every ledger + event lives in **ClickHouse**
(`galexie → ClickHouse → decoders → Postgres`). **Postgres/TimescaleDB is
the SERVED tier** — the recent working set the API queries, NOT the full
archive. Re-backfilling Postgres for full history was abandoned as
infeasible (OLTP-for-OLAP, billions of rows). Consequences:

- **"100% coverage" = the ClickHouse substrate captured everything**
  (provable: ledgers contiguous + hash-chained to genesis). The served
  tier is verified faithful *within what it holds* (ADR-0033 projection
  reconcile, retention-scoped).
- **Raw `trades` are kept forever** in Postgres — migration 0031 removed
  the old 90-day retention (storage is not a constraint). If you see a
  `drop_after` retention policy on `trades`, it's drift — remove it.
- **Continuous aggregates**: `prices_1h/4h/1d`+ are indefinite (daily
  OHLC spans back to 2015); `prices_1m/15m` retention was also removed.
- **Decoder backfills re-derive from the lake** (SQL / `ch-rebuild`), not
  MinIO walks. Projected-source catch-up is `projector-replay`.

## Things that will surprise you

Traps / counter-intuitive facts about Stellar and our dependencies.
If you're about to do something that touches any of these, the
linked design doc has the full detail.

- **Soroswap's `SwapEvent` has no post-state reserves.** Reserves
  come in the immediately-following `SyncEvent`. Correlate by
  `(ledger, tx_hash, op_index)`.
- **Phoenix emits 8 events per swap** (one per field with a 2-tuple
  topic `("swap", "<field>")`). A single swap reconstruction
  requires grouping all 8.
- **Comet uses a shared `("POOL", <event>)` topic across every pool
  contract**, not a per-protocol namespace. Any pubnet contract that
  deploys Balancer-v1 Comet code will look identical on the wire.
  **ADR-0035 factory-anchored contract gating is only PARTIALLY rolled out.**
  Only `soroswap` (pair/factory registry) and `blend` (childgate) currently
  gate `Matches()` on contract identity. **`aquarius`, `defindex`, and `comet` still match on topic
  bytes alone** (ungated; phoenix gained its curated-set gate 2026-07-02) — so a look-alike
  contract emitting the same topic shape can inject fabricated trades under
  those sources (see docs/audit-2026-06-30/ CS-026). Comet is the *hardest*
  case (no factory namespace — needs a pool allowlist / WASM-hash gate), not
  the only one. Until each gate lands, narrow coverage for those sources is a
  downstream filter on `Trade.Source = "<name>"` + contract address. →
  [docs/adr/0035-factory-anchored-contract-gating.md](docs/adr/0035-factory-anchored-contract-gating.md)
- **Reflector v3 has no on-chain `twap` or `x_*` methods.** Some
  upstream docs imply it does; it doesn't. We compute TWAP and
  cross-pair locally.
- **Reflector is three separate contracts** (DEX / CEX / FX), not
  one.
- **Band stores pair rates at E18 scale**. Relayed single-asset
  rates are at E9.
- **Band's Soroban contract emits zero events.** A conventional
  topic-match Decoder never fires on Band. We observe the
  `relay()` / `force_relay()` InvokeContract call instead via
  the dispatcher's `ContractCallDecoder` interface (PR 168). Any
  future Soroban source that updates storage without publishing
  events plugs into the same hook — match by (contract_id,
  function_name), decode from op args.
- **Off-chain sources (CEX/FX) live in `internal/sources/external/`,
  not `internal/sources/<venue>/`.** They run their own goroutines
  speaking HTTPS / WebSocket to vendor APIs — parallel to the
  Galexie → dispatcher path, not under it. Source-class metadata
  (`exchange`/`aggregator`/`oracle`/`authority_sanity`) lives in
  `external.Registry` — a single Go map the aggregator queries at
  VWAP compute time to decide which sources contribute. Only
  `ClassExchange` contributes by default; aggregators and oracles
  are reported alongside but excluded (mixing them double-counts
  upstream markets or imposes their methodology on our output).
- **External-source amount scaling is NOT uniform.** On-chain
  sources stamp `canonical.Trade.BaseAmount` / `QuoteAmount` at
  per-asset decimals (XLM=7, Soroban tokens vary). Off-chain CEX +
  reference-aggregator sources normalise to a fixed **10^8** integer
  scale (`binance.externalAmountDecimals`), but the **FX pollers**
  (`ecb` / `exchangeratesapi` / `polygonforex`) use **10^6**
  (`DefaultDecimals = 6`). Always read the per-source `Decimals`
  field; don't assume 10^8. Aggregator looks up
  `external.Lookup(trade.Source).Class` to know which side of
  the boundary a trade came from.
- **Stablecoin fiat-proxy is aggregator policy, not decoder
  policy.** Ingest stores the real pair (`XLM/USDT`, `XLM/USDC`).
  The aggregator maps `USDT→USD`, `USDC→USD`, `DAI→USD`,
  `PYUSD→USD`, `USDP→USD`, `EURC→EUR`, `EUROC→EUR`, `EUROB→EUR`,
  `MXNe→MXN` at VWAP compute time (full map: `internal/aggregate/stablecoin.go`).
  Eager normalisation at ingest would hide a depeg event; late
  binding keeps data honest.
- **Redstone Adapter DOES emit events** (topic `"REDSTONE"`) — one
  per batch push containing all updated feeds. Subscribe rather
  than poll all 19 per-feed contracts.
- **Redstone's event body carries no feed_id.** `WritePrices
  { updater, updated_feeds: Vec<PriceData> }` gives prices +
  timestamps, not which feed each entry is. Feed IDs live in the
  tx's `write_prices(updater, feed_ids, payload)` InvokeContract
  op args — plumbed through `events.Event.OpArgs` (PR 166). The
  adapter's freshness verifier can filter `updated_feeds` to a
  subset of `feed_ids`; zip only when lengths match, else skip
  the whole event (`ErrFeedIDCountMismatch`). Any new decoder that
  needs tx args follows the same `events.Event.OpArgs` pattern.
- **Post-P23 (Whisk, mainnet 2025-09-03) every classic asset
  movement emits a unified transfer/mint/burn event with a 4th
  `sep0011_asset` topic.** Our decoder handles both event SHAPES —
  the 3-topic SEP-41 form and the 4-topic CAP-67 form (the 4th topic
  is `sep0011_asset`). It does NOT, however, parse pre-P23 classic
  movements: there is no operations+effects fallback for the era
  before unified events existed, so historical classic-asset movement
  before P23 is not reconstructed from this path.
- **SEP-41 `transfer` data can be EITHER a simple `i128` OR a map**
  containing `amount` + `to_muxed_id`. Type-test before
  `MustI128()`.
- **stellar/go monorepo was archived 2025-12-16.** The new Go SDK
  lives at `github.com/stellar/go-stellar-sdk`. Horizon, Galexie,
  stellar-rpc, stellar-archivist are each in their own repos now.
- **`withObsrvr/cdp-pipeline-workflow` has verified correctness
  bugs** in its i128 decoding and SDEX trade extraction. We do
  **not** inherit from it.
- **stellar-rpc is NOT in our production ingest path.** The
  standalone `stellar-rpc` and `stellar-core` watcher services were
  removed from r1 on 2026-04-23, along with the core prometheus
  exporter. `stellar-core` itself still runs on r1 — but only as a
  *captive-core* subprocess spawned by Galexie
  (`/usr/bin/stellar-core … --metadata-output-stream fd:3`) — which
  is the supported Galexie deployment shape per ADR-0002. The
  indexer reads Galexie's MinIO output directly via
  `go-stellar-sdk/ingest.ApplyLedgerMetadata`. If you catch yourself
  writing `rpc.GetEvents` for ingest, stop and read
  [docs/architecture/ingest-pipeline.md](docs/architecture/ingest-pipeline.md). →
  [docs/operations/r1-deployment-state.md](docs/operations/r1-deployment-state.md)
- **Soroban DeFi contracts upgrade in place.** Soroswap / Phoenix /
  Aquarius / Reflector can each `update_contract` without changing
  their contract address. Event body schemas (field names, types,
  arity) and topic shapes can change across an upgrade. Live ingest
  only sees current WASM; **backfill sees every prior version** that
  ran for the replayed range. Decode by Map-field-name not position,
  dispatch on topic[0] symbol not contract address, and gate
  backfill behind a per-WASM-hash decoder audit. →
  [docs/architecture/contract-schema-evolution.md](docs/architecture/contract-schema-evolution.md)
- **`/v1/assets/{slug}` returns two different wire shapes.**
  When `{slug}` is a verified-currency catalogue slug (`usdc`,
  `eurc`, `aqua`, …) the handler returns `GlobalAssetView`
  (Stellar-asset identity + headline USD price + Stellar issuance);
  when it's a canonical asset_id (`USDC-G…`, `native`, `C…`,
  `fiat:USD`) it returns `AssetDetail` (per-Stellar-asset detail).
  Same route, two shapes — Go's mux dispatches on the catalogue
  lookup before parsing as canonical. Clients distinguish via
  wire-shape discriminators (`ticker` + `price_usd` vs `asset_id`
  + `type`). The old cross-chain `networks[]` array + the
  `/v1/assets/{slug}/{network}` drill-down were removed in the
  Stellar-focus refactor (docs/architecture/stellar-focus-refactor-plan.md).
- **`internal/currency` is the verified-currency trust surface.**
  Hand-curated YAML at `internal/currency/data/seed.yaml`, embedded
  in the binary via `//go:embed`. Adding a verified currency means
  a code change + redeploy. The catalogue feeds the CG poller's
  ticker map, the indexer's aggregator pair set, the
  unverified-collision warning on `/v1/assets/{id}`, the
  `/v1/assets/verified` listing endpoint, and the explorer's
  verified-badge UI. Do NOT auto-populate from CG / CMC — the
  whole point is that it's hand-vetted.

Since 2026-07-03 the archival-node playbook applies cleanly to r1 and a
weekly `ansible-drift.yml` workflow fails on divergence. The rule:
**any config change on r1 lands in `configs/ansible/` in the same PR**
(secrets → `ansible-vault edit inventory/r1.secrets.yml`). Hand fixes
without codification WILL page Monday morning. Apply changes via
`ansible-playbook -i inventory/r1.yml playbooks/archival-node.yml
--tags <area>` — always `--check --diff` first. Findings log:
docs/operations/r1-ansible-drift-2026-07-03.md.

## Heavy one-shot jobs on r1 — ALWAYS use the wrapper

Any ops one-shot on r1 (re-derives, backfills, bulk SQL, census
walks) runs under `/usr/local/sbin/run-heavy-job.sh <name> <cmd…>` —
a systemd scope with MemoryMax=20G, MemorySwapMax=0, and batch-class
CPU/IO weights. Never run a heavy binary raw: on 2026-07-05 an
unwindowed re-derive ballooned silently, swapped galexie's captive
core into an `invalid local state` wedge, and froze the lake for 11
hours. The wrapper kills a ballooning job before it can starve the
consensus-critical processes; galexie itself carries MemoryLow=16G +
elevated CPU/IO weight, and `stellarindex_galexie_catchup_refused`
pages if the core ever refuses catchup again. One heavy job at a
time remains the rule.

## Common task recipes

### "Bring up a new archival node" / "recover from disaster"

End-to-end recipe in [docs/operations/archival-node-bringup.md](docs/operations/archival-node-bringup.md).
Six steps from a fresh box to a running indexer (greenfield ≈ 10–13 h
wall, mostly bandwidth). Same doc has the disaster-recovery triage
tree (corrupt history-archive, partial galexie-archive partition,
wiped postgres, lost MinIO data dir).

Per-region storage shape varies by provider — see
[ADR-0016](docs/adr/0016-per-region-storage-strategy.md): R1
(Hetzner) is the full-mirror integrity leader; R2 (AWS) reads
galexie data direct from `aws-public-blockchain` S3, no local
mirror; R3 (Vultr) keeps galexie-archive on Vultr Object Storage
hybrid. R2 + R3 trust R1's primary verification but run their own
Tier A + Tier D periodically as defence-in-depth. The cross-region
"all regions serve the same rate" property is preserved by
[ADR-0015](docs/adr/0015-last-closed-bucket-rate-serving.md)'s
closed-bucket-only API contract.

### "Add a new CEX connector"

CEX/FX venues are NOT under the Galexie → dispatcher path and do NOT
use `internal/sources/<venue>/` or the on-chain five-file convention.
They live directly at `internal/sources/external/<venue>/` and
implement the `external.Connector` framework
(`internal/sources/external/framework.go`), not `consumer.Source`.
Copy the `binance` / `kraken` package as the template.

1. Review the venue's public API docs for its real endpoints + pair
   conventions before writing the parser.
2. Create `internal/sources/external/<venue>/` following the
   actual per-package layout: `events.go` (wire types), `parse.go`
   (vendor JSON → `canonical.Trade`), `streamer.go` (live WS/REST;
   implements `external.Streamer`) and/or a poller, `backfill.go`
   (historical OHLC; implements `external.Backfiller`), and
   `pairs.go` (symbol map). Tests sit alongside as `*_test.go`.
3. Implement the relevant `external.Connector` sub-interface(s) —
   `Streamer` (live push, e.g. binance/kraken), `Poller` (REST quote
   board, used by the FX pollers), and/or `Backfiller` (historical
   candles). NOT `consumer.Source` — that's the legacy on-chain seam.
4. Register the venue's `Metadata` (class / subclass / weight /
   `IncludeInVWAP` / `BackfillSafe`) in the `Registry` map in
   `internal/sources/external/registry.go`, then wire it into
   `buildExternal` in `cmd/stellarindex-indexer/main.go` (and the
   parallel block in `stellarindex-ops`) behind a `cfg.<Venue>.Enabled`
   gate.
5. Fixtures are inline golden frames in the package's `*_test.go`
   (e.g. `binance/streamer_test.go`) — there is no
   `test/fixtures/external/` directory.
6. Add an ADR if the venue has unusual constraints (e.g. requires
   paid tier, or has licensing restrictions on redistribution).

### "Add a new on-chain Soroban DEX"

**Full step-by-step checklist: [docs/contributing/add-onchain-source.md](docs/contributing/add-onchain-source.md).**
The package is SIX files (`README.md`, `events.go`, `decode.go`, `consumer.go`,
**`dispatcher_adapter.go`** — the production seam that implements `dispatcher.Decoder`;
this is the object the dispatcher actually calls — and `source_test.go`), PLUS **six
wiring edits in other packages** (config `KnownSources`, `pipeline/dispatcher.go`
BuildDispatcher, `pipeline/sink.go` HandleEvent + IsProjectedEvent,
`projector/registry.go` buildSource, `external/registry.go` Metadata). Miss a wiring
edit and the source compiles, registers nowhere, and silently emits nothing. Template:
`internal/sources/soroswap/`. Reuse the shared helpers (`internal/scval`,
`canonical.Amount`) — check CAPABILITY-INVENTORY.md before writing utilities.

### "Add a new supply observer"

Read [docs/architecture/supply-pipeline.md](docs/architecture/supply-pipeline.md)
first — it covers the three-domain split (Algorithm 1 XLM /
Algorithm 2 classic / Algorithm 3 SEP-41), which dispatcher hook
each observer plugs into, and where the per-class hypertables
live. New observers ship as a Go package with package-level docs
in `doc.go` (not `README.md` — supply observers follow Go
package-doc convention; `events.go`, `decode.go`, `consumer.go`,
and a `dispatcher_adapter*.go` pair complete the layout). Pick the
right dispatcher hook based on what the source emits:

- `LedgerEntryChangeDecoder` for `LedgerEntry` mutations (current
  use: AccountEntry / trustline / claimable / LP-reserve
  observers).
- `OpDecoder` for classic operations (e.g. `change_trust_op`).
- `Decoder` (event-based) for Soroban contract events (current
  use: SEP-41 mint/burn/clawback observer).

The reader/storage seam is the same across all three: each
observer writes to a per-class hypertable
(`migrations/0011-0014_*.sql` etc.), and `StorageClassicSupplyReader`
/ `StorageSEP41SupplyReader` aggregate the rows at refresh time.
Wire the new observer into `cmd/stellarindex-indexer/main.go`
alongside the existing supply observers and add an integration
test under `test/integration/` if it touches NUMERIC arithmetic
(see PR #316 / #317 for the testcontainers-go pattern).

### "Audit a Soroban source's WASM history (flip BackfillSafe)"

Procedure: [docs/operations/wasm-audits/README.md](docs/operations/wasm-audits/README.md).
One audit log per source under that directory; each is the
evidence trail for flipping `internal/sources/external/registry.go`'s
`BackfillSafe` flag from `false` → `true`. The flag gates
`stellarindex-ops backfill` from running an unaudited Soroban
source against historical ranges (CLAUDE.md "Soroban DeFi
contracts upgrade in place").

### "Investigate a price divergence"

Start at [docs/operations/runbooks/price-divergence.md](docs/operations/runbooks/price-divergence.md).
Aggregator-layer alerts (silent / outlier-storm / class-drop-spike)
have their own runbooks under the same directory; see
[docs/architecture/aggregation-plan.md](docs/architecture/aggregation-plan.md)
for the policy chain that drives them.

### "Find why a metric is alerting"

Every alert references a runbook at `docs/operations/runbooks/<alert-name>.md`.
If it doesn't, that's a CI failure.

### "Add a new Prometheus metric"

1. Declare the metric in `internal/obs/metrics.go` (one of the
   typed `*Vec` variables near the bottom) and register it in
   **`registerAppMetrics()` / `registerAppMetricsTail()`** (NOT
   `init()` directly — `init()` delegates to those, which are split
   to stay under the `funlen` ceiling).
2. Wire it at the point of observation. For goroutine workers
   doing IO, the established pattern is paired:
   - `*Total{outcome}` counter for outcomes (per-attempt count).
   - `*DurationSeconds{outcome}` histogram for latency.
   Operators chart `outcome="ok"` p95/p99 separately from
   failure outcomes to detect "endpoint slow" vs "endpoint
   failing" independently. The wave-88/89/90/91 series
   (`customer_webhook_delivery`, `divergence_refresh`,
   `aggregator_supply_refresh`, `anomaly_freeze_recovery_sweep`)
   are the canonical examples.
3. Document in `docs/reference/metrics/README.md` with a
   when-to-look-at-this prose block.
4. If the metric warrants alerting, add a rule to BOTH
   `deploy/monitoring/rules/<area>.yml` (multi-host) and
   `configs/prometheus/rules.r1/<area>.yml` (R1 overlay). CI's
   `monitoring-rules` job validates both directories with
   promtool (wave 96); the wave-82 lint catches sibling-file
   presence and the wave-78 template-presence lint catches
   missing runbook structure.
5. Write a regression test in the worker's test file using
   `obstest.HistogramSampleCount` (`internal/obstest/`,
   wave 100) — the helper exists because
   `HistogramVec.WithLabelValues(...)` returns a
   `prometheus.Observer` not a Collector, so the official
   `testutil.CollectAndCount` can't act on per-label children
   directly.

### "Change the OpenAPI spec"

1. Edit `openapi/stellar-index.v1.yaml`.
2. Regenerate **every** spec-derived artifact and commit the diffs —
   three separate generators, and it's easy to forget the last two
   (both have silently drifted onto main before):
   - `make docs-api` — rendered reference + colocated YAML (the only
     one `make docs-all` and the CI drift-lint cover).
   - `make docs-postman` — `examples/postman/…json` (deterministic
     since the generator's RNG is seeded; NOT drift-guarded).
   - `make web-generate-api` — `web/explorer/src/api/types.ts`, the
     explorer's compile-time contract (NOT drift-guarded).
3. Handlers in `internal/api/v1/` get updated; contract tests
   verify they match.
4. Bump the API minor version if the change is additive, major
   if breaking.
5. CHANGELOG entry under `[Unreleased]`.

### "Cut a release"

We use SemVer (`vX.Y.Z`) for binary releases — see
[docs/architecture/semver-policy.md](docs/architecture/semver-policy.md)
for what bumps the major / minor / patch.

End-to-end (operator side):

1. **Curate `CHANGELOG.md` `[Unreleased]`** — make sure every entry
   cites a PR, every empty section is deleted.
2. **Promote the section** in a one-commit PR: replace `## [Unreleased]`
   with `## [vX.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` and add a fresh empty `[Unreleased]`
   block above it. Title the PR `release: vX.Y.Z`. Squash-merge once
   CI is green.
3. **Cut the tag** via the guard-rail script:
   ```sh
   git checkout main && git pull --ff-only origin main
   bash scripts/dev/cut-release.sh vX.Y.Z
   ```
   The script verifies branch + clean tree + sync + non-empty CHANGELOG
   section + green `verify.sh` before tagging and pushing. Pass
   `--dry-run` first to see the plan.
4. **`release.yml` fires automatically** on the tag push:
   - Cross-compiles every binary in `cmd/` for `linux/amd64`
     (arm64 was dropped 2026-05-08 — every region is amd64; re-add
     when an arm64 host is provisioned).
   - Computes SHA256SUMS
   - Auto-extracts the matching CHANGELOG section as release notes
   - Creates the GitHub Release (marked `--prerelease` if the tag
     contains a `-suffix`)
   - **Does NOT publish container images.** The previous GHCR job
     was dropped (no consumer existed); see
     `docs/operations/release-process.md` for the rationale.
     F-1221 (2026-05-13): pre-fix this paragraph claimed both
     amd64+arm64 and GHCR pushes — both were stale.

Full runbook + manual fallback in
[docs/operations/release-process.md](docs/operations/release-process.md).

### "Deploy a release to R1"

Deploys are operator-triggered, never automatic on tag.

```sh
gh workflow run deploy.yml \
  -f region=r1 \
  -f version=vX.Y.Z \
  -f binaries=stellarindex-indexer,stellarindex-aggregator,stellarindex-api
```

The workflow downloads the binaries from the GitHub Release,
verifies SHA256SUMS, and runs an Ansible playbook over SSH that
does **stage → backup → atomic install → restart → health probe →
automatic rollback on failure**. Backups land at
`/usr/local/bin/<binary>.prev-<previous-tag>` with the most-recent
5 retained.

One-time setup: 4 GitHub secrets per region. Full operator runbook
including the rollback path: [docs/operations/deploy-workflow.md](docs/operations/deploy-workflow.md).

R2 / R3 are deferred — adding them is mechanical (4 secrets +
~4 lines of workflow YAML), no playbook changes needed.

## Agent skill library (.claude/skills/)

Nine project skills encode this repo's procedures + incident-corpus
judgment as executable checklists. If you are an AI agent doing one
of these tasks, INVOKE THE SKILL rather than working from memory:

| Skill | Use for |
|---|---|
| `/add-onchain-source` | new Soroban protocol: six files + six wiring edits + gating + the lockstep checks |
| `/add-cex-connector` | new CEX/FX venue: Connector framework + the scaling traps |
| `/add-endpoint` | API route/shape changes: spec + 3 generators + SDK triage + cache policy |
| `/add-metric` | metric + BOTH rule trees + runbook + the five-lint guard chain |
| `/cut-release` | CHANGELOG promote + guard-rail tagging (one release per session) |
| `/deploy-r1` | deploy workflow + post-deploy verification battery + rollback |
| `/review-stellarindex` | per-subsystem adversarial review checklists from the F-####/CS-### corpus |
| `/diagnose-stellarindex` | r1 incident decision trees (frozen cursor, stale prices, verdict red) |
| `/verify-done` | the pre-completion gate stack every other skill ends with |

## How to ask for help

- **Code review:** the appropriate CODEOWNER (see
  [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS)).
- **Architectural decision:** propose an ADR in `docs/adr/` with
  status `Proposed`. Discuss in PR.
- **Security issue:** `security@stellarindex.io` — do not open
  a public issue. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
- **General contribution questions:** [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## If in doubt

Make the smallest possible PR that advances one thing and is easy
to review. Never "ship and clean up later." See
[docs/engineering-standards.md §2](docs/engineering-standards.md)
for the full Definition of Done.

## Working in a long session: commit-merge-repeat, not stack-then-split

If you are an AI agent running a multi-hour task (e.g. `/loop keep
going`), the default cadence is **one PR → one merge → next PR**.
Do NOT accumulate multiple narrative PRs of uncommitted work in the
tree and try to split them later — shared files
(`cmd/stellarindex-indexer/main.go`, `internal/config/*`,
`CHANGELOG.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) will be touched by several narrative
PRs and cannot be cleanly split into per-PR commits without hunk
surgery.

The rule:

1. Pick one logical unit of work.
2. Make it build + its tests pass.
3. Commit, push, open PR, merge. (`gh pr merge --squash` once CI is
   green; merge with failing optional checks only if the failure is
   pre-existing CI infra, not caused by this PR.)
4. Pull main, branch again, return to step 1 for the NEXT unit.

Never plan a pipeline of 3–4 PRs before the first one has landed.
If you realise a task is bigger than one PR, split it into linear,
merge-as-you-go units — not parallel branches that will collide on
shared files.

The one exception: if the user is actively reviewing mid-session
and explicitly says "don't merge yet, I want to see the whole thing
first." Otherwise, merge.
