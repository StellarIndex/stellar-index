# ADR-0033 completeness-verdict refresh — self-chunking driver.
#
# compute-completeness.service runs this on a daily timer. For EACH source it
# walks [its current watermark, ledgerstream tip] in CHUNK-ledger windows and
# re-verifies via `stellarindex-ops compute-completeness -ch`, advancing the
# source's watermark.
#
# Why per-source + chunked (not one global `-from min(watermark)` run):
#   1. The watermark write OVERWRITES (ON CONFLICT … SET watermark = EXCLUDED),
#      it does not max() — so a global run with `-to < tip` would REGRESS the
#      watermark of any source already further ahead. Iterating per-source with
#      each source's own watermark avoids that.
#   2. The high-volume SDEX projection reconcile blows ClickHouse's 12 GiB
#      per-query memory limit above ~30k ledgers (verified: 25k OK, 68k OOMs).
#      CHUNK=25000 keeps every window safe.
# Self-healing: any backlog — the initial 17-21-day catch-up or a post-outage
# gap — is walked automatically; in steady state each source is one ~daily-sized
# chunk, so a normal tick is fast.
#
# Same DSN sourcing as compute-archive-to.sh (peer-auth fails under systemd's
# restricted user-switch context).
