# galexie append wrapper.
#
# Galexie's `append` subcommand requires --start <ledger>. On a
# fresh deploy there's no prior cursor, so we need to pick a start
# ledger that is actually reachable from the history archives.
#
# CRITICAL: do NOT start from stellar-core's live tip. Archives
# publish checkpoints with ~5-15 min lag. If galexie starts at
# "now," every archive 404s on the HAS file and captive-core
# spins forever waiting for it to appear. Instead, query SDF's
# `.well-known/stellar-history.json` for the *archive's* current
# tip — that's guaranteed to have an HAS file already uploaded.
# We additionally round down to a checkpoint boundary and subtract
# a safety margin so captive-core has solid ground.
#
# On a restart after galexie has already exported some ledgers,
# we'd ideally resume from "last-exported-ledger + 1." TODO: probe
# MinIO galexie-live for the latest object and derive. For Phase 1
# we always start from the archive tip; duplicate exports are
# content-addressed so reprocessing is idempotent.
