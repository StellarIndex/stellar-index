# the result to Healthchecks.io. Distinct from heartbeat.sh: that
# probes the metrics port (process up); this one verifies the
# public API surface (schema + data integrity).
#
# Catches regressions the per-binary heartbeats can't see — e.g.
# /v1/price returning a 200 with malformed JSON, /v1/coins missing
# the `data` field, an OpenAPI-spec change that breaks downstream
# clients.

# URL comes from /etc/default/ratesengine-healthchecks
# (HEALTHCHECKS_URL_SMOKE). Empty URL silently runs the smoke
# script for journal-only coverage.
